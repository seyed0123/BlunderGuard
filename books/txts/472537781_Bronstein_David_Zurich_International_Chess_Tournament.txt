Myself, I have read chess books that were entertaining, and those that were instructive; some that were historic, and a few that were downright bad. But never have I encountered a book written with such powerful style and such obvious passion for the game. The passion is infectious. The translation you hold is the final pro­ duct of ten years' work and four revisions- and still, I feel that it wanted more effort ••• so you can see the fascination Bronstein's book had for its translator! If my translation can infect you, the Reader, with half of that fascination, then it will be a job well done. I must thank Jack O'Keefe for his meticulous proofreading and price­ less editorial work. Jim Marfia [iii] INSTEAD OF A PREFACE As I began work on my first chess book, I put myself mentally in the reader's place, recalling the excitement with which I used to open each new chess book, hoping to find vital thinking there, clear words, and a wondrous tale of the art of chess. I absorbed a great deal from books, and to this day I cherish the memory of the best of them. Books about chess tournaments belong to a special class of litera­ ture, which would seem at first blush to be rather restrictive of the author's creative possibilities, since he must write, not on themes of his own choosing, but about chess material already created. But this is not quite true. The author is free to treat the games any way he wishes, to make generalizations, and to uncover the ideas and plans actually ex­ ecuted, as well as those that could have occurred in the actual or some other game. The book of a strong tournament is more than just a games collection. When its participants are the world's strongest players, then the games are mutually interdependent, and brimming with ideas, which crystallize and develop as the event progresses. Thus, the tournament as a whole represents a step forward in the development of chess creativity. We may take as examples of such tournaments the events at Hastings 1895, St Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1935, and Groningen 1946. Be­ yond doubt, Zurich-Neuhausen 1953 deserves a place among them. In working on this book, I started from the premise that every full­ bodied game of chess is an artistic endeavor, arising out of a struggle between two masters of equal rank. The kernel of a game of chess is the creative clash of plans, the battle of chess ideas, which takes on its highest form in the middlegame. This book examines a number of standard positions which occur as a result of the collision of plans; also examined are such strategic con­ cepts as darksquare weaknesses, the advantage of the two bishops, play and counterplay on opposite wings, the relative strengths of the pieces, overprotection, and so forth. Such elements of the struggle as intui­ tion, resourcefulness, and determination are discussed too. The games of a tournament of grandmasters bring the reader into the creative circle of the contemporary leaders of chess, showing him the rise and fall of battle as well as the manner in which a game of chess is created. It is the author's intention to discourse upon the least ex­ plored and most interestin� stage of the game: the middlegame, and the way it is handled by today s grandmasters. That is the basic aim of this book. The author has tried to avoid weighing down his book with variations. Variations can be interesting, if they show the beauty of chess; they become useless when they exceed the limits of what a man can calculate; and they are a real evil when they are substituted for the study and clarification of positions in which the outcome is decided by intuition, fantasy and talent. Along with this, it was my hope that the player who read this book wouia raise himself thereby to a rather higher level of playing strength. The reader will see errors, too, in the games of this tournament; but he will not be too severe in his judgment of the masters if he pictures to himself the peculiar nature of the chess struggle. At the board there sits a living person, with all his everyday thoughts and worries, some­ times far removed from chess. While selecting his plan, or even his next move, he cannot hel� thinking about his standing in the tournament, re­ membering yesterday s result, looking at other games. A game is not an analysis: everything must be worked out in one's head, without moving the pieces, without consulting a book or asking advice from anyone ••• [v] The grandmaster thinks and thinks -- one last look at the clock -­ "Time to decide; I' 11 risk it! " -- and the knight goes to eS. Of course it's easy, a whole year later, after studying all of the analyses and spendin� days on the position, to tell the reader, with absolute cer­ tainty: A mistake; the careful Nel was to be preferred .•. " It may be that mistakes will turn up in my analyses and evaluations as well, although I have tried to keep them to a minimum. It is my hope that the reader will be indulgent, and help me to correct them. It is with trepidation, then, that I submit my work to the judgment of the readers. I will consider my ends achieved if the contents of this book expand the reader's chess horizon, increase his mastery of the game, give him some idea of the state of the art, and help him more fully to value -- and still more to love --- the depths of chess. [vi] PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION Now that my book is ready for its second edition, I would like to explain today what I had to pass over in the preface to the first edi­ tion four years ago. The work I submitted to the readers' judgment at that time was a work which had little in common with the commentar ies usu­ ally seen in the chess press. "Rotework" is a thing abhorrent to art and lit­ erature alike; thus, it should be still less acceptable in chess, which ac­ tually falls somewhere in an intermediate zone between art and litera­ ture. I do not wish to say anything against the numerous tournament and reference books that are being published, but for some years now a con­ siderable decline has been noticed in the appetite of chessplayers for this type of literature, and yesterday's insatiable demand has slack­ ened. Under these circumstances, how would the public accept a large and unfortunately rather expensive tournament book, such as this one? I had no wish to become a variations-monger; nor did I want the role of annotator-cum-guide. I felt that the author' s ideas and conclusions should form the basis of this book, wi th the moves played in each game serving to annotate them, as it were. I tried to let the book's contents display the richness and limitless expanse of chess ideas, and to let the format resemble that of a literary work. To judge from all the accepted indicators, the author appears to have accomplished his purpose, at least in part: the book sold out very quickly, and the reviews were favorable. Most valuable to me, however, were the many letters and opinions I received from readers (and I re­ gret not having answered nearly enough of them) . There I found, along with justified criticism of my book' s shortcomings, approval of the basic principles by which it was written. Those letters have been the finest possible reward for my labors, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt thanks to all who wrote me. I should like especially to thank Peter Romanovsky for his detailed review (helpful to readers and the author alike) which appeared in "Shakhmaty v SSSR". I was happy to agree to the publishers' suggestion of a second edi­ tionj I intended to excise all obsolete and unimportant materials, to develop other material a bit more fully, and to expand the preface to reflect the most recent developments in the world of chess. Thus, this second edition devotes a great deal less space to text, in games which did not serve my purpose of uncovering and describing the ideas of the art of chess. This applies especially to games from the later rounds, when the final standings of the tournament had already been largely determined, and the tension had slackened somewhat. Addi­ tionally, two or three errors in analysis, discovered by the readers and the author, have been corrected; the proofreading has been up­ graded, and some diagrams revised. I would like to close this segment with the hope that in the future my chessplaying audience will continue to aid the author in his work with their alert criticism, as well as their words of praise. Since this is a book devoted mainly to the middle phase of the game of chess, it might be appropriate to begin with a few words about the evolution of opening ideas and the modern openings repertoire. In former times --- shall we say, the latter half of the preceding century--- a game generally opened with the king's pawn, to which Black would, in the majority of cases, reply l •• e7-e5. Such defenses as the Sicilian and the French were also employed, of course, but less frequently. With some e�ceptions, over half of the games played in any tournament would be open games, and sometimes a much greater percentage than that. At the close of the last century and the beginning of the [vii] present one, the closed games for White and the semi-open games for Black became very �opular. Thus, in the Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904, the Queen s Gambit was the most common opening, with the Ruy Lopez second and the Sicilian third. The Indian defenses also began to appear in the tournaments of the 1890's and 1900's: these were the har­ bingers of new ideas. The 1920's witnessed the almost total disappearance of the open games, with the exception of the Ruy Lopez, from important tournaments, and the rise of the Queen's Gambit and other Queen's Pawn games. White's success with the Queen's Gambit and the Ruy led gradually to the pop­ ularization of the asymmetrical defensive systems: the Indian against 1 d2-d4, and the Sicilian against 1 e2-e4. This was a very fruitful period for the development of opening ideas. The victories of the young grandmasters were closely bound up with their discovery of new openings: the Nimzo-Indian, Reti's Opening, Grunfeld's Defense, Alekhine's De­ fense. At the strong double-round tournament at Bled 1931, which included Alekhine, Bogolyubov, Nimzovich, Vidmar, Flohr, Tartakover, S�ielmann and Maroczy, among others, 77 Queen's Gambits and other Queen s Pawn games were played; of these, White won 29, and Black only 13. In the same event, 21 games used Indian Defenses, of which White could win only 2, while losing 14. Is in any wonder that, in the era that followed, en­ compassing the 1930's and 1940's, fewer and fewer Queen's Gambits would be seen? The careers of many Soviet and non-Soviet players owed a great deal to the creation and development of new systems in the King's Indian and Sicilian, as well as in the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfeld Defenses. To­ day, one may separate all openings, Black and White, into three major groupings. In the first grouping, both sides follow classical principles, devel­ oping pieces, occupying space, creating a pawn center, avoiding weak­ nesses, etc. This is the shape of the struggle in the great majority of variations of the Queen's Gambit, Ruy Lopez, French, and some systems of the Sicilian and Nimzo-Indian Defenses. Black knows that in these variations, especially in symmetrical positions, the advantage of the first move counts heavily, and he faces a long and patient struggle for equality. He has few winning chances, but if he works hard and plays cautiously, he may get a draw. The results of the World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine may be taken as typical for such openings. Of the thirty-four games of that match, thirty-three opened with the queen's pawn; twenty-five games were drawn, White won six, and Black two. Masters nowadays tend to avoid such openings, shunning sym­ metrical setups in favor of defenses which offer counterchances. Thus we come to the second group of openings, in which one side fol­ lows classical principles, while the other side consciously flouts a few, in order to obtain active play for his pieces, or an attack on the enemy pawn center, or sometimes sim�ly for the sake of complicating. Such are the main lines of the King s Indian, Sicilian, Grunfeld and Nimzo-Indian, and some forcing lines of the Queen's Gambit. To the third group we may assign those openings in which White uses the opening phase not to occupy, but to control, the center squares, avoiding early definition of the pawn structure, and retaining maxi­ mum flexibility, while preparing for a war of maneuver. While this is going on, White is ready to stir up complications at an appropriate moment, or--- should he secure some positional plus --- to boil the game down to a technical stage. This group comprises the Closed Variation of the Sicilian, a number of lines in the Reti, the English, the King's Indian Reversed, and a few others. It should be noted here that giving an opening a name does not auto­ matically set the course of the opening struggle. For example: in the Queen's Gambit, one may play the Orthodox Defense, which is a typical form of the struggle on a classical footing. But one may also playBot[viii] vinnik's line, or the risky "Peruvian" variation, with forcing play and counterchances for Black. The Queen's Indian is not one of the symmet­ rical openings, but it does not give Black any real counterchances at all. And the Nimzo-Indian, one of the most outstanding and hardiest of defenses the "Hypermodern" school of the 1920's ever produced, allows a flexible transition either to positional schemes or to sharp varia­ tions. These changes in our conception of the opening closely �aralleled the development of chess ideas in general. The Queen's Gambit s greatest popularity coincided with the period when chess was completely dominated by the pr,inciples of the positional school. With all the good these principles have done, their one major shortcoming must be pointed out: the evaluation of positions by externals alone. In the eyes of Tarrasch's disciples --and he was the propagandist of Steinitz' ideas --such fac­ tors as a backward pawn, or a powerful pawn center, or an advantage in development, were decisive, both in the evaluation of one's own position and in setting up a plan of action. "If one piece stands poorly, the whole game stands poorly," said Tarrasch. The principles of the posi­ tional school, expressed in simple instructional form by Tarrasch, be­ came inviolable axioms of chess to many of his contemporaries. And thus arose the misconception, which persists to this day, of the so-called "consistent" game, in which one player carries out, from beginning to end, his logical plan, almost as if he were demonstrating a theorem of geometry. In the annotations to such an "ideal" game, one player always appears as the keeper of principle, the other as its transgressor. The "good" player then accumulates positional advantages and places them in av ault, much as if he were saving to buy a motorcycle. Having accumulated the proper amount, he then launches a combinative attack, winding it up with an instructive mate, or with a still more instructive win of the ex­ change. And just what, you may ask, was his opponent doing all this time? Why, gazing phlegmatically at his backward pawns and poorly-p,laced pieces, shrugging his shoulders, and then finally: "Black resigns. ' I doubt if it needs to be demonstrated that such games never occur be­ tween two grandmasters of equal ability, and that the annotators -- a role generally assumed by the winner -- turned what they wished to be into what actually happened. The views of the positional school held sway in chess for a long time, but their weak side came to light in the 1920's. As the Queen's Gambit began to fade from the openings lists, so the names of Nirnzovich, Reti, Tartakover and other masters began to appear more and more frequently at the top of tournament crosstables, while these players carne out strongly against one-sided understanding and exaggeration of the role of positional principles. Around 1935, the young masters of our country made their internation� al debut, with Botvinnik at their head; later, they were to advance to the forefront of the world's players. Their continuing successes gave some observers the impression of a Soviet school of chess � some sort of aggregate of identical chess ideas and views. I don't fina this to be entirely true. As a matter of fact, the Soviet family of chess masters includes players of the most diverse styles. For example, Spassky and Petrosian, to judge from their styles of play and differing conceptions of the game, are as unlike one another as were Spielmann and Schlechter; and Tal as is far removed from Botvinnik as Lasker was from Capablanca. Now, what sort of ideas characterize the 1950's? What contribution did this tournament in Switzerland make to the development of-these ideas? And what is to be the direction of further progress in chess? First, let us note the great erudition of chessplayers who have ab­ sorbed the experience of previous generations, allowing them now to [ix] fight with still more courage, forethought, fantasy and risk -- all based on sober assessment of the pros and cons of the intended oper­ ation. Our understanding of positional play has matured immeasurably. Where Tarrasch taught us to avoid weaknesses in our own position while striv­ ing to create them in our opponent's position, to accumulate small ad­ vantages, to occupy open lines, and never to begin an attack without sufficient grounds, today things are sometimes done altogether differ­ ently. We might give ourselves weak spots and weak pawns, in order to distract our opponent; give up open lines, in order to save the rooks for other, more promising plans; or mount an attacking demonstration, in order to hide our real intentions. The number of standard defensible positions, which every chessplayer knows he can fall back on in case of need, has also grown by leaps and bounds. We now find that many positions which were formerly consid­ ered lost can be defended successfully, even actively; but this requires, firstly: a tense game of calculation, and secondly: the ability to per­ ceive the proper moment to abandon the weakness to its fate and carry the fight to a new sector. Only now has it become clear that this was precisely Emanuel Lasker's standard approach to the game, and that one of his major advantages over his rivals lay in the fact that none of them understood it. On the other hand, this approach was hardly Lasker's only distin­ guishing characteristic. He was the game's great psychologist, who knew better than anyone how to make the pendulum of battle swing left, then right, never overstepping the bounds of safety himself, while impercep­ tibly goading his opponent over the edge. He would deliberately play second-rate moves, practically inviting his orthodox opponent to punish him. Nowadays, even this style has been analyzed and superseded. Today's players are ready at times to give their opponents what would appear to be a positional advantage from the very first moves. Clear examples of this are the positions that arise in the King's In­ dian after •• e5:d4, as well as the group of positions after 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS e6 4 Nc3 ed 5 cd. The Boleslavsky Variation .of the Sici­ lian, with its gaping hole at dS and the hopelessly backward pawn on d6, might seem unbelievably daring, but nonetheless it withstands ev­ ery assault. In this book, we will find a number of such examples. The reader will also find here descriptions of the technical ways and means employed by the contemporary master in the middlegame. The concept of technique is much broader now than it was a few decades ago, andwhat was once a rare occurrence, a lucky find, is now the tool of the masses. Without technique, one cannot attain mastery of any form; it is no less impossible in chess. However, the importance of technique in chess should not be exaRger­ ated, either. The end phase of the game, frequently described as a matter of technique", is certainly not always that clear and simple. Thirty years ago, Capablanca was considered the greatest technical player in the world; today it is Smyslov. After analysis of the so­ called technical games of Capablanca and Smyslov, I concluded that they are based on the combinative element and on far-seeing and accurate an­ alysis, and that as a consequence their technique is of an unusually high order. The same could be said, to a greater or lesser degree, of the endgames played by man¥ grandmasters. I will mention onl¥ two here from this tournament: Euwe s against Stahlberg, and Gligoric s against Euwe. Another characteristic quality of the contemporary creative output, which the reader will note more than once in the games of this tour­ nament, is a readiness to react instantly to any change in the oppo­ nent's plans, and to make radical alterations in one's own plan, if [x] given sufficient justification. One of the most prominent -- and prom�s�ng -- tendencies which came forward in the course of this tournament was a penchant for wide-open piece play almost from the first moves. Apparently Morphy's style re­ tains an irresistible fascination for chessplayers in every age, and a return to this style, refined perhaps to a higher level, is the dream of all players, grandmasters included. To me, it appears that we are closer to this ideal now than we have been at any time in the past cen­ tury. This new tendency, whose representatives have blazed a trail through the USS R Championships, the 1955 and 1958 Interzonal tournaments, and the 1959 Candidates' tournament, is characterized by an effort to take the game out of its logical channels at any cost, redirecting it into the combinative -- or, more accurately, the calculative. The material side of the question -- a pawn more or an exchange less -- has no spe­ cial significance. There is absolutely no need to demonstrate the com­ bination's correctness in every variation. More likely the reverse may be true: in the majority of cases, it turns out that the defending side could have held out by finding a series of saving moves. But here the New Wave grandmaster trusts in himself and in his phenomenal ability to calculate a vast number of long and complicated variations. Sometimes this can give the game a very strange turn indeed. As one positional master said, "I fought him (a master of the calculative style) for thirty-two moves, and never guessed his r�ply, except once, when he had to take my queen." The foremost advocates of this dynamic style today are undoubtedly Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. Of course, complicating and turning the game into a war of calculation are not the only weapons in the arsenal of these unusually talented and well-rounded players. They are past masters of the techniques of positional play, conduct brilliant endgames, know the openings well, and surpass other masters precisely in their skill at giving the game a dynamic twist, making it the sort of game which is absolutely impossible to evaluate by landmarks; willy-nilly, one must then play "move by move", or perhaps even "variation by var­ iation". The time came for one of them to try his mettle, and the viability of his personal style, in single combat against the most powerful player of the past two decades: Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik. The results of that encounter and of the tournaments that led to it show, first of all, that in Mikhail Nekhemevich Tal we have the representative of a definite new direction; and second, that the existence of this direction does not by any stretch of the imagination signify an end to the kind of chess strug­ gle that is based not only on the computation of variations, but on logic and principle as well. The author of this book, in the course of his twenty-year life in chess, has played quite a few sharp, tense games, where he had to bal­ ance for a while on a sw ord edge; but I would certainly be the last to conclude that chess consists so lely of calculating variations. And I would hope that, rather than see the further course of chess his tory bear out such a conclusion, the new style of play will instead become but one of many elements in the arsenal of creative techniques that are comprised in the art of chess.

Szabo-Geller (Catalan Opening) I have long suspected, when­ ever the books I have read began discussing darksquare weaknesses or an attack on the dark squares, that the subject under discussion was not only beyond my understan­ ding, but beyond the author's as well. "Certainly,", I would say to myself, "it must be true that the enemy dark squares will be weak if his pawns stand on light squares and he loses his dark­ square bishop. But if he then removes all of his pieces from the dark squares, what will be left for me to attack?" Such was my line of reasoning, until the day I realized that a weakness of the dark squares is also a weakness of the pieces and pawns on the light squares. Light­ square weaknesses are also possi­ ble, resulting in a weakening of the enemy pieces and pawns on the dark squares --- as occurred, for example, in the Geller - Najdorf game in Round 13. The point of an attack on the dark squares is that, by placing my pawns and pieces on the dark, I attack my opponent's pieces and pawns on the light. The Szabo - Geller game pro­ vides a clear example of the me­ thod of exploiting a darksquare weakness; and the combination which was possible after Black's 24th fairly begs to be included in a textbook, taking place as it does entirely on light squares. 1. c2-c4 2. g2-g3 3.

Qc4-c6 Ng8-f6 e7-e6 d7-d5 d5:c4 Nb8-d7 a7-a6 b7-b5 Having hatched a plan to weak­ en the enemy dark squares, Szabo undertakes a delicate maneuver aimed at bringing about the ex­ change of the darksquare bishops, which will further strengthen his grip on the dark squares. 8. 9.

Nb1-c3 Bf8-e7 Qd8:e7 Bc8-b7 c7-c5 Nd7:c5 Rb8-c8 Nd5-f6 A small but serious inaccuracy: Black removes this piece from the main theater of operations. Addi­ tionally, the combination 17N:b5 ab 18 b4 now becomes possible, due to the insufficiently protected rook at c8. Szabo, however, con­ tinues with his plan, fixing the pawns at a6 and b5 on their light squares. 16 .• Nb6 would have been much better for Black: increasing his control of c4 would have made it more difficult for White to decide. on b2-b4. 17. b2-b4 18.

ReS, White would simply take the rook: 22 Q:c8+ B:c8 23 R:c8+ NeB 24 Ne5!, and there is no stopping 25 Bc6. 22. a2-a3 Nf6-d5 Seeing that White's position­ al squeeze could become very dan­ gerous, should he succeed in oc­ cupying the seventh rank or in establishing his knight on c5, Geller decides to complicate (his move also stops both threats). 23. Qc3-d4 24. Nf3-el 25. Qd4-c5 f7-f6 e6-e5 A consistent, though rather un­ inspired, continuation. 25 Qa7! would certainly have been much prettier, retaining his hold on the dark squares while attacking the enemy pieces and pawns on the light squares. Black would be un­ able to smoke the queen out, since 25 .. Ra8 would obviously fail ag­ ainst 26 B:d5+; while after 25 .. Kf8 26 Nd3 Ra8 2 7 Qc5, the ex­ change of queens would bring the white knight to c5. And finally, 25 .. Rd7 brings on an elegant lit­ tle combination: 26 Q:b7! If Black takes the queen, then 27 B:d5+, followed by 28 ReS+ leads to the complete extermination of Black's pieces - curiously enough, all of them perish on light squares. Black may have intended to ans­ wer 25 Qa7 with 25 .. e4, and if 26 B:e4, not 26 .. Nf4? (which would be nicely refuted by 27 Bf3), but simply 26 .. Q:e4 27 Q:b7 Q:e2, with an unclear �arne. On 25 .. e4, how­ ever, White s bishop would leave the blocked diagonal for an equ­ ally successful career on its neighbor (with 26 Bh3). 25. 26. b4:c5 Qe7:c5 White would have maintained a clear advantage with 26 R:c5, but Szabo probably thought that his pin on the knight, combined with his threat to advance the c-pawn would assure him victory. However, Black finds the defensive maneu­ ver .. Rd8-d7-e7. 26. 27. Rcl-dl 28. Bg2-h3 29. Nel-c2 30. Bh3-g2 31. Bg2-h3 32.

Nb1-c3 Bf8-b4 4. e2-e3 Aron Nimzovich, who invented this defense, could hardly have thought that thirty years later the masters of chess still would not have solved the basic prob­ lem: whether �utting the ques­ tion to Black s bishop with an immediate 4 a3 is good or bad. Naturally, if we knew it to be good, that would render all oth­ er tries pointless, to say the least. 4. 5. Bf1-d3 6. Ng1-f3 c7-c5 0-0 d7-d5 Nimzovich never used to ad­ vance his c-pawn to cS without need; he hoped that, after he gave White doubled pawns by means of the exchange at c3, sooner or later he could induce White to play d4-d5, after which he could establish his knight at c5. A lot of water has gone un­ der the bridge since, and the modern master puts no great stock in that far-otf prospect of capi­ talizing on the doubled c-pawns. Instead, the immediate counter­ attack on the center with every means available has become one of the standard ideas for Black in the Nimzo-Indian. 7. o-o 8. a2-a3 9. b2:c3 10. Bd3:c4 Nb8-c6 Bb4:c3 d5:c4 Qd8-c7 Today, this position has been studied as thoroughly as were the Muzio and Evans Gambits a century ago. What are the basic features of this position, and how does the evaluation of those features give rise to the further plans for both sides? The placement of White's pieces radiates a great deal of poten­ tial energy, which ought to be [3] converted into kinetic-White must set his center pawns in motion, activating both his rooks and his deeply-buried darksquare bishop. The most logical plan would seem to be the advance of the e-pawn, first to e4, and then to eS, to drive Black's knight from f6 and lay the groundwork for a kingside attack. Black in turn must either pre­ vent the e-pawn's advance or counterattack the white pawn center, which will lose some of its solidity the moment the pawn advances from e3 to e4. In this game, Reshevsky com­ bines both of Black's ideas to achieve a favorable disposition of his forces, while Najdorf does not put nearly enough vig­ or into the execution of his plan. 11. a3-a4 Of all the possible continu­ ations that have been used here, this one may well be the least logical: it resolves only one minor problem, the development of the queen' s bishop- and to a poor square, at that. The pawn at cS will find defenders eas­ ily enough, and the bishop will find itself out of the action. That outflung pawn at a4 will not be a jewel in White's posi­ tion either. 11. 12. Bc1-a3 13.

White cannot play 18 Rb1, and 18 Nd2 is not attractive either. 18. Rf1-d1 Rd8: d1+ ( Po si tio n aft er 17 .. Rab8 ) 19 . Ra 1:d 1 Be4- c6 !

Nor ought we to forget Bla ck' s bishop at g 7: si nce Bla ck inte nds to le ave his e- pawn at e7 in this system, the bi shop 's sphere of act ivity is auto matic­ ally incr ease d . And fi nal ly, there is the inter est ing st rat e­ gi c idea (e nc ount ered al so in other var iat ions of the King's Indian ) of deve l oping the queen ' s rook wit hout moving it from its orig inal square .

Qd 1-c2 Fi ftee n year s ago , the King 's Ind ian Defense was pla yed in So­ viet tournament s only by those wis hing to avoid the pass ive , thoroughl y analyzed var iati ons of the Queen 's Gambit Dec li ned ; out si de our borde rs , it was hard­ ly pl ayed at al l. As recent ly as the 1948 Wor ld 's Champio nship , the King's Ind ian fi gured in on­ ly two game s out of fi ft y. Here [11 ] in Zurich , one out of three game s opened wit h 1 d2-d 4 turned int o a King 's Ind ian , and fo re ign pl ayer s use d it just as ofte n as ours di d. The di agrammed posit ion is a fami li ar one to the ory ; the text move is one of the late st di sc ov­ eries . Wish ing to deve lo p his bis hop to e3, White also over­ protec ts his e- pawn! The knight at d4 is temporar i­ ly unde fended , of co urse , and Bla ck co uld win a center pawn by 12 .. Nf :e 4 13 N:e 4 B:d 4; but then it would be White' s turn to move , and he would se iz e the key sq uare f6 wit h 14 BgS Qd7 15 Nf6+ B:f 6 16 B:f 6, removing Bla ck's "I n­ di an" bis hop , wit hout which all Ind ian conf igura tio ns bec ome poi ntl ess . The extra pawn would be no co nsola t ion: occas io na l at­ tempts to prove otherwis e have near ly al l wound up dis ast rous ly fo r Bl ack , so no one snaps at the e- pawn anymore . 12 . 13. Be 1-e3 14 . Ra1-d1 a5 -a4 c 7-c6 Nf6-d7 Charact eristi cally, the King 's Ind ian Defe nse fe ature s a tense bat tle waged on all fronts si m­ ul tane ous ly . The sys tem used here secu re s White cons id erab le terri­ tor y , not only in the ce nter, but on the kings ide as we ll. I do not wis h to le ave the reader the false impre ssi on that White 's fur ther task, which is to tr&ns form his siz able sp at ial pl us int o a material advanta ge , wi ll be an easy one . The se cret of the King's Ind ian 's hard ihood is that , while conced ing sp ace , Bl ack buil ds a few smal l but we ighty de tails into his conf ig­ urat io n. For emost among the se are his lo ng-range bis hops at g7 and c8 , his fi rmly entr enched knight at cS and the rook at e8, which maintain cons tant watch on the e­ pawn . Nor ought we to forget his pawns . The "weak" pawn on d6 is just wait ing for the chance to push to dS, so White must con­ ti nuall y keep an eye on that . The pawn at a4 als o has an important ro le : the threat to advance it to a3 can up set his oppo nent 's pl ans fo r that secto r at any ti me, so White must take extra pre caut io ns regarding the defense of c3 and c4. If 12 Qc2 was White's latest theoretical discovery, then the same might justifiably be said of Black's 14 .• Nfd7. 14 .. Qa5 was the old move, but after 15 Bf4, either the bishop at g7 or the rook at e8 had to move to an in­ ferior position, whereas now the pawn can be covered with 15 •. Ne5. 15. f2-f4 16. Be3-f2 17. Bg2-f1 18. a2-a3 Qd8-a5 Nd7-b6 Bc8-d7 Stahlberg decides to rid his position once and for all of the threat of a black pawn advance to a3. This move deprives the square b3 of pawn protection, but it also strengthens the po­ sition of the pawn at b2 and generally of the whole constel­ lation a3-b2-c3. The next stage of the game roughly to move 30- consists of skillful maneuvers from both sides, inducing weaknesses, White's preparation for e4-e5 and Black's for .. d7-d5 or •. f7f5, and mutual prevention of these breaks. 18. 19 . Kg1-h2 20. Nc3-a2 21. Bf1-g2 22. Na2-c3 23. Nd4-f3 Ra8-d8 Bd7-c8 Nb6-d7 Nd7-f6 Rd8-d7 Rd7-e7 The next two moves are some­ what unusual, both for White and for Black: Black concen­ trates maximum firepower against the pawn at e4, an assault which White tries to divert by threat­ ening to take on d6. It is en­ tirely characteristic that, in order to carry out this idea, White can find no better re­ treat square for his central­ ized knight at d4, the pride of his position, than back to its original square g1, since all other retreat squares would in­ terfere, in one way or another, with the coordination between his pieces. This seems an appropriate time to impart to the reader the sec­ ret of the d6-pawn in the King's Indian Defense. This pawn, al­ though backward on an open file, proves nevertheless a tough lit[12] tle nut to crack, because it is so hard to reach. It might seem that nothing could be simpler than dropping the knight back from d4, but the problem is that White needs his knight precisely on d4, where it observes the squares bS, c6, e6 and fS, and neutralizes the power of the bi­ shop at g7. Only after White has taken precautions against all of Black's possible attacks ( .. a4a3, .• Bc8-e6, .• f7-f5) can his knight allow itself to leave the center; but meanwhile Black has time to regroup. So the weakness of the d6-pawn turns out to be largely fictive. Modern methods of opening play allow for many such fictive weak p,awns, but it was precisely this 'permanent" weakness at d6 which so long condemned the King's In­ dian to the list of dubious open­ ings. 24. Nf3-g1 The knight will return, five moves later, to help the pawn on e4 cross the Rubicon. The pawn could have been pushed at once, but that would have given up con­ trol of the fS square; Black's bishop could go there, and after 24 eS BfS, White would have had to sacrifice his queen by taking the knight at f6 with his pawn but that would win for White . The simple 24 •• de, on the other hand, would give Black excellent play. White could have taken the a­ pawn here, but at too great a price: White needs his darksquare bishop as much as Black does. Boleslavsky's 24th move is an invitation to White's rook to cap­ ture that long-disputed point at last; after 25 •• Nb6, however, Black's knight enters c4. Stahl­ berg's decision is most probably the correct one: before proceed­ ing with the siege of the d-p,awn, he exchanges off the "I ndian ' bi­ shops. 24. 25. Bf2-d4 26. Bd4:g7 27. Rd1:d6 28. Rd6-d1 Nf6-d7 Nd7-b6 Kg8:g7 Nb6:c4 Bc8-e6 The position appears basically unchanged, but an important event has taken place: the disappear­ ance of the darksquare bishops, and of the pawns at c4 and d6. With the bishops' disappearance, both sides must now make some ad­ justments in their basic strate­ gies. Black, for example, must give top priority to securing his position on the long diago­ nal, and against the incursion of a white pawn to f6 and queen to h6. Considering the serious­ ness of this threat, Boleslavsky's last move was a very good one: the bishop is ready for action on the a2-g8 diagonal, and the f-pawn, by going to f6, covers the king against any attacks from the main road; the bishop replaces the pawn at f7. White, for his part, must punch a hole in this new defensive line at any cost, or else the initiative will pass to his opponent, and all the weaknesses in White's position, which were of only passing int­ erest so long as he was on the offensive (b3, the lack of pawn control of d3, c3 and f3 and the passive bishop at g2 �, might become the basis for combinations. 29 . Qc2-f2 30. Ngl-f3 31. e4-e5 f7-f6 Be6-f7 Stahlberg is a consummate tac­ tician, and a master of the king­ side attack, and this sacrifice is in his style. White cannot be left master of eS, so the pawn must be taken; but this opens the f-file, and Black's king comes [13] under fire. 31. f6:e5 32. Nf3:e5 Nc4:e5 33. Rel :eS Re7:e5 34. f4:e5 Re8:e5 35. Rdl-fl ReS-fS In the heat of battle, Bole­ slavsky disregards his fierce time-pressure and declines the draw he could probably have se­ cured by means of the accurate retreat 35 .• Qc7, defending aga­ inst both threats, 36 Q:f7 and 36 Qf6+. Black's dream of capi­ talizing on his extra pawn is impractical, considering his ex­ posed king. Even if Black should successfully run the gauntlet, warding off all assaults, White could still, in all probability, find a perpetual check. 36. Qf2-d4+ ...

White initia­ ted a powerful attack on the king by sacrificing his c4-pawn. This attack gave Geller every hope of success, provided Black held to the traditional sort of queen­ side counterattack. Euwe, how­ ever, carried out two remarkable ideas: 1) utilizing his queen­ side lines of communication for an attack on the king's wing, and 2) decoying the enemy's forces deep into his own rear area, with the aim of cutting them off from the defense of their king. It's a most diverting specta­ cle to watch White' s pieces in their frontal assault on the king, burrowing further and further, while Black is transferring his forces by roundabout routes. 1. d2-d4 Ng8-f6 2. c2-c4 e7-e6 3.

Nc6 and .. 0-0; and White, who failed to notice in time to react correctly with 7 Ne2, must now spend an extra tempo preparing e3-e4. Such details should never be underestimated, but neither should they be overvalued. Occa­ sionally it is said that White's advantage consists of his right to the first move: should he lose a tempo, then, the advantage must necessarily pass to Black. Prac­ tically speaking, however, the ad­ vantage of playing White boils down to greater freedom in selec­ ting a plan to suit one's tastes; once the game has settled into its ordained track, the loss of a single tempo is not always so serious. 8. 9. Ng1-e2 10. 0-0 11. e3-e4 Nb8-c6 0-0 Nc6-a5 Nf6-e8 Black retreats his knight to forestall the pin with 12 Bg5, and to be able to answer f3-f4 with .. f7-f5, blockading the king's wing. White therefore secures fS before advancing his f-pawn. It would be senseless to defend the pawn at c4 now: that pawn was doomed by White's fifth move. 12. Ne2-g3 13. c3:d4 14. f3-f4 15. f4-f5 16. Rf 1-f4 c5: d4 Ra8-c8 Na5:c4 f7-f6 ��ite's attack has become ra­ ther threatening. Black's pre­ vious move was necessary to fore­ stall White's intention to push his pawn to f6, and then, after 16 .. N:f6, to pin the knight af­ ter all, piling up on the king with the combined firepower of queen, rooks and three minor pieces. Even now, White needs only two moves to transfer his rook and queen to the h-file, and then it might appear that nothing could save the black king. Euwe, however, is not easily fl ustered. Remember that in his lifetime he played more than seventy games with Alekhine, the most feared attacking player of (17) our time. 16. b6-b5! The beginning of a remarkable plan. Clearly, any defensive ma­ neuvers on the kingside are fore­ doomed, since they involve pieces with an inconsequential radius of activity ( .. Rf7, .. Qe7, etc. ) . But Black does have another de­ fensive resource, and that is counterattack! The bishop at b7, the rook at c8, and the knight at c4 are all well-based; all that remains is to bring up the queen. The basis for this counterattack is Black's preponderance on the central squares. With 16 .. b5, Black reinforces the knight on c4 and opens a path for the queen to b6 . Still, one cannot help feeling that his operations are too little and too late .. . 17. Rf4-h4 Qd8-b6 Pinning White's queen to the defense of the d-pawn, Black prevents the intended 18 QhS. After 17 QhS Qb6 18 Ne2 Ne5, we get the echo-variation, with the white rook unable to get to h4. 18. e4-e5 19. fS: e6 20. Qd1 :d3 Nc4:e5 NeS:d3 Qb6:e6 All of White's moves required detailed and precise analysis. Here, for example, the natural 20 ed would fail to 20 .. Qc6. 21. Qd3 :h7+ Thus, White has broken through after all, at an insignificant cost. Once again, Black's posi­ tion appears critical . 21 . 22. Bc1-h6 Kg8-f7 Rf8-h8 If Black' s 16th move was the beginning of his strategic plan of counterattack, then this rook sacrifice is its fundamental tac­ tical stroke, with the aim of drawing the white queen still further afield and decoying it away from the c2 square, mean­ while attacking the king. 23 . Qh7 :h8 Rc8-c2 Threatening mate in a few moves: 24 .. R:g2+, 25 •. Qc4+, etc. De­ tailed analysis, requiring more than just one week's time, showed that White could have saved him­ self from mate by finding a few "only" and very difficult moves. First, he has to play 24 d5; if then 24 .. Qb6+ 25 Kh1 Qf2 26 Rg1 B:d5, White saves himself with 27 Re4!; and on the immediate 24 .. B:d5, not 25 Rd4--- only 25 Rdl! works: after 25 .. R:g2+ 26 Kf1 gh, neither 27 R:h6 nor 27 R:dS: once again, the only move is 27 Q:h6. Black would still have bishop and two pawns for his rook then, which would leave him good winning chances, considering the open position of White' s king. It goes without saying that Geller had no prac­ tical chance to find all of these moves over the board. [18] The analysts also showed that the .. Rf8-h8 idea was actually a little premature, and that .. Rc4 first was better. However, those who love chess will find it dif­ ficult to agree with this. Moves like 22 .. Rh8 are not forgotten. 24.

Generally speaking, such evaluations, even though they may sway the opinions of the theoreticians, have far less of an influence on practical tournament games than is commonly supposed. 10. c4:d5 11. Bc1-b2 e6:d5 . . ' . Try�ng to �mprove one s posltion, and finding the correct [1 9] idea to accomplish that end, is one of the bases of chess strat­ egy in every phase of the game. The proper move order also plays an important part, but this falls under the heading of tactical im­ plementation, which of course is a major determinant of the even­ tual success of the strategic plan. Here, White's basic idea is obvious: he needs a good devel­ opment for both his bishops. He can accomplish this in two ways: either by playing a4 followed by Ba3, or by taking de be, and then playing c4. Apparently against all logic, however, White places his bishop on a diagonal which is occupied by pawns, seemingly in­ viting Black to play .. c4 him­ self, and shut the bishop in for good. Why? As it turns out, 11 a4 would have been met by 11 .. cd 12 cd Bg4, or 12 ed Ne4, attack­ ing the c-pawn; and 11 de be 12 c4 would allow the reply 12 .. Rb8, preventing 13 Bb2. Having played 11 Bb2, however, White can go ahead with his c3-c4, either at once or after the pre­ liminary 12 de be; so Black's re­ ply is not merely useful, but al­ most obligatory. The next phase of the struggle is defined by the new pawn structure: already it has much less to do with the tastes and preferences of the two players than it has to do with their choice of opening. White will set his f- and e­ pawns in motion, creating a passed d-pawn and combining the advance of these central pawns with an attack on the f-file. Black, with three pawns to two on his right wing, cannot do too much with them for the moment, since he must first battle the white bishop pair and central preponderance. 11. 12. Bd3-c2 13. Qd1-e1 c5-c4 Bc8-g4 Nf6-e4 Black could have altered the course of the struggle here by taking the knight: 13 •. B:f3 14. gf NhS; but he refrained from doing so. The standard ex­ planation -- White would be left with the two bishops, a strong pawn center, and the open g­ file -- could hardly have de­ terred him, since one bishop would be blocked by its own pawns, and the pawn center is not dangerous for the moment. If 15 e4, for example, then 15 .. Nf4 16 Khl Qh4 17 Bel Nd3 18 B: d3 cd 19 Qe3 de 20 fe Rfe8 21 f3 f5 22 e5 Rad8, and the pawn at d3 is taboo. However, after 13 .. B: f3 14 gf Nh5 White could systematically strengthen his position with f4, f3, Qf2, Rael, Bel, Khl and e4, in that or in some other or­ der, depending on how Black re­ plies (R gl mig ht also prove ne­ cessary, etc. ). A direct attack on the king would be Black's only possible counter, and it would have had very small chances of success, considering his re­ stricted maneuvering space: the pawn barriers hamper the mobility of his knights. Petrosian continues following his own line, figuring that as long as he has made no unsound moves, nor upset the positional balance, he will not risk finding himself in a losing position. 14.

Bc2-d1 We have grown accustomed to seeing this bishop on d3 or c2 or bl, at least -- participating in a kingside attack .

Black must stop White's pawns, so Petrosian gives up the exchange at a spot of his own choosing, freeing e7 for the transfer of his knight to d5. Of course, Black gets good compensation for the exchange: hi s knight is much stronger on d5, as is his bishop, which no longer has an opponent. Note that here, or even on the pre­ vious move, White might have launched a direct attack with h4 followed by h5 and Rg3, with good winning chances; but he ex­ pects to win a different way . 26 . a3-a4 Provoking 26 •. b4, when there would follow 27 d5 R: d5 28 B: e6 fe 29 Q:c4 (2 8 Q: c4 Rd: e5 would have been weaker), but Petrosian perseveres with his plan. 26. 27 .

Qdl-c2 12. h2-h3 13. f2-f4 Na6-c7 a7-a6 Ra8-b8 0-0 Bc8-d7 b7-b5 The positions of Black's �ieces give the e- and f-pawns an lnsen­ sate urge to advance. White is acquiring more and more territo­ ry; the pawn now at b5 is hardly compensation for Black's cramped position: for instance, compare the rooks at f8 and fl. 13. 14. a4:b5 15. Ral-a7 16.

Qc2-b3 Nc7:a8 f7-f6 Since the queen cannot remain tied forever to the pawn at e7, Black decides upon a weighty step: shutting in his own bishop. 19. Bg5-h4 20. Qb3-a3 21. b2-b3 22.

The threat is 24 Nf4 g5 25 Ne6 gh 26 N:f8; additionally, his last move helped fix the black e- and f­ pawns on dark squares. Still, White might have given some thought to the transfer of his bishop to a different diag­ onal. It has already done its work here by inducing .. f6, and might have caused Black consid­ erable grief after 23 Bel. 23 Ral was also possible, but although an immediate 23 .• f5 would not work in view of 24 e5 de 25 d6+ Kh8 26 de etc. , White would al­ ways have had to consider an eventual .. f5 anyway. 23. 24. f5:g6 25. e4-e5 26. b3:c4 27. Qa3-d3 Bg7-h6 h7:g6 Bb5:c4 d6:e5 Why did White sacrifice that pawn? Can't Black begin a coun­ terattack now? Not yet; and, meanwhile, White needs only two or three moves --- Nc3 and Rbl, for example -- to take over all the key points on the queenside, and then to pick up the c5- or the e7-pawn. The knight's poor placement at a8 helps White greatly in the execution of this plan. 27. 28.

By thi s exchange in the c en­ ter, Bl ack has opened his bis h­ op 's di agona l to at tac k the d4 square ; short ly , he wi ll also at tack the pawn at e4 with roo k and knight . The knight 's positi on on c5 wi ll be se cured with .. aS , and thi s pawn may also be pushed furth er : to a4 , and even to a3 . For the moment , White att acks not hing , but he does di spose of a st rong center and freedom to maneuver. Look at the board : White 's pi ece s and pawns occupy fo ur ranks , and Bl ack' s, three , with a "no -man' s- land" bet ween . The se geo metri cal feat ure s large­ ly re fl ect the character of the open ing , as the oppos ing fo rce s have not yet come into conta ct . White 's further pl ans are si mple : to deve lop the bis hop and the queen , to connect his ro oks , pre­ pare an at tack on the weak pawn at d6 with which Bl ack must even­ tuall y sadd le him self in this de­ pl oyment , and keep an eye on the defense of the e-p awn. The di f­ fe r ing ways to def end this pawn le ad to dif fe rent sys tem s of pl ay. Qc2 wou ld be a handy move , but thi s wou ld lea ve the knight on d4 en pr ise for a moment , which Bl ack might be able to exploit ; if Be 3 is pl ayed fi rst, then Bl ack has .. Ng4 . It is this so rt of tempo-p lay , wit h its many co m­ bi nat ive pos si biliti es (due to the fac t that all of the pi ece s and near ly all of the pawns are still on the boar d) , that makes the King's Ind ian Defense such a de l ight to its adherents . 9. 10. f2-f3 Nd7- c5 Before le aving for thi s tourna­ ment , every one of it s partici­ pant s prep ared a few new system s , es pec ia ll y in the popu lar openings such as the King 's Indian , the Si­ cili an and the Ni mzo- Indi an . One of the bes t of the se must be the sys tem Averbakh intr oduc ed in the pre sent game : f3, and Rf2 -d 2 . White prep are s an at tack on the d-p awn, but pract ice has sho wn that it make s li ttl e sense to take it with the queen , si nce on d6 the queen itself becomes vulner­ ab le to at tack , and mus t quickl y retr eat , The enemy camp must there­ fore be invaded wit h a weaker pi ece fi rst .

Nb1- c3 e7- e5 A radical means of avoiding both the Sami sch and the Four Pawns ' Attack . Whatever White pl ays , the pure Sami sch se tup is now unat tainable : for example , after 4 d5, Black is by no means obl iged to fianchetto his bis hop , but may pl ay ins tead 4 •• Bf5, and if 5 f3 e4 .

And on 4 de de 5 Q: d8+ K:d 8, Black 's king forfe its cas tl ing, but wi ll fi nd she lt er at c7 . However , White still has ways of exploi ting Black 's ear ly e- pawn push , and the one Keres has in mind is 5 Bg5 , a rare ly-p layed li ne which is neve rthe less one of White 's most soli d posi tional ideas . 4. Ng1 -f 3 Nb8 -d7 5.

Black , of course , could pl ay 5 .. Be7, but that so rt of deve lopment for this bi shop grat es on a King 's Indi an pla yer . In that case , White would have a si m­ple program: 6 e3, 7 Be2 and 8 0-0 with no fear of .. e5 -e4 , si nce his queen 's bi shop is alr eady out si de his pawn cha in. Boles lavs ky, who has worked ste adil y and wit h immense suc ­cess at improv ing the King 's In­dian for Black , feels himself mor­all y obl igated to co rrect exta nt opinio ns ; for thi s game , he has prep ared a dizz ying new li ne in­vo lving the sacr ifi ce of his queen 's rook . 5. 6. Bg5 -h4 7. d4 : e5 h7 -h6 g7 -g5 If the bi shop retre at s again, the e- pawn rushes to the third rank, with the we ll- known idea of reta rding White 's kingsi de [58] deve lopment : 7 Bg3 e4 8 Nd2 e3"; but now we enter Bo les lavs ky's main li ne . 7. 8. e5 :f 6 9. Nc3- d5 g5 :h4 Qd8: f6 Qf6: b2 Some pie ces in the King 's In­dian appear on a "s peci al price" li st: the darks quare bi shop s are at the to p of that list . This means that Bl ack has achieved something , in removing White 's bi shop while re taining his own, even at the cost of shat ter ing his own pawns . Wit h his last move , Black initiates his previo us ly prepared sharp atta cking line , sacr if ic ing a rook for the at tack. The at tack will be based on the fact that the centr al ized knight is out of pl ay at a8 ; the whole quest ion is whether Bla ck can work up dec is ive threa t s in the short time it wi ll take White to develop his bi shop and get his knight back to the center . Bo les lavsky had mainly cons id­ered the follo wing li ne , in which his darksquare bish op plays the lead : 10 N: c7+ Kd8 11 N:a 8 d5 ! 12 Rc1 Bb4+ 13 Nd2 NcS 14 Rc2 Qe5 15 e3 Bf5 .

Ra1-b1 The simple move which Bo lesl av­sky overloo ked in his prep aratory analys is . After 10 N: c7+ Kd8, the move 11 Rb1 would be no prob lem for Bl ack , si nce he would have the check on c3 ; here , however, with the knight on dS , the check is impo ssi ble , and Black 's whole at­tack is ref uted . 10. 11.

Bronstein- Euwe (Nimzoindian Defen se) Generally, it makes sense to sacrific e a pawn, someti mes even a piece , in order to keep the en­emy king in the cent er and ass ail it wit h roo ks and queen. However , two genera l cl as ses of such at ­tacks must be di st ingui shed : in the fi rst cate gory, the king is kept to the ei ghth rank, hemmed in by its own pawns and pieces ; whil e in the se cond cate gory , the king is driven out to the si xth rank -- somet imes even to the fift h -- and atte mpts to find she lter on one wing or the other. The pres ent game is an example of the lat ter type . The defe nder 's chief reso urce is a cool head , and my opponent made ful l use of his here . At one po int , I had to break off my calc ulat ions in order to ask myself : Jus t who is at tack­ing whom here ? During the game , and aft erward s as well, I was unable to shake the fee ling that somewhere I had had a win . Perhap s some concre te variat ion di d fl icker momentar il y through my mind , but it tarried not ... In any event , neither I, nor the commentators (E uwe , Naj ­dorf and St ahl berg) have been able to find an improvement for White , which would mean that my promi sing pi ece sacrif ice was not enough for a win . Perhaps the win may yet be found in analys is ; but even if I di d not get the poi nt , I did get a li vely and inter est ing game . 1. d2 -d4 2. c2-c 4 3. Nb1- c3 4. e2-e 3 5. Bf 1-d3 6.

Ng5- e4 Re4-e7 g7- g6 Bg4-f 5 Bot h si des have pl ayed into thi s li ne , which invo lve s the sacr if ice of a piece . Black weakened the long di agonal by playing 18 .. g6 ins tead of the more natura l 18 •. fS , becaus e he wanted the fS square kept free for his bis hop ; and White is giv­ing up the pie ce in order to get the black king out to f6 and e6 , and then as sail him with al l his pi ece s. The battl e waxe s uncom­monly fi erce . 20 . Ne4-f6+ Kg8-g7 21. Qc2-d2 At this moment , I was quite pleased with my pos it ion. In­deed , after 21. Kg7 :f 6 Black 's king can never get back to g7 , but must remain in the center , as sai led by bot h roo ks , queen , bis hop and perhaps even , by pawns . However , my opponent s face showed no si gn of de spair ei ther --- an obj ect lesso n for the young pl ayer who finds him­self in dif fi cul ties (es peci all y when fac ing a mat ing at tack) , and choke s up at once , thereby ren­der ing his defe ns ive task still more diffi cult . 22. d4-d5 Here I examined 22 Bb2 and 22Q h6 too . The text is strong er : it re­tai ns both those threats whil e creat ing a thir d : 23 d6 . 22. Ra8- d8 A remarkab le move : Bla ck br ings up the last of his defe ns ive re­ser ves , and obviat es all three of White 's threats at a st roke . 23 Qh6 would now be met by the calm 23 •. R: d5 , and on 23 Bb2+, Black pl ans to return the pi ece . Even here , I was quite opt imisti c sti ll, feeli ng that wit h materi al equal­ity res tored White 's attack would be all the st ronger . 23. Bc1- b2+ 24 . f2 -f 4 Nc6 -e 5 24 Rad 1 was worth a loo k, but I could not see anything for cing and dec ided not to take any unneces sary risk. 24 . Qc7-c5 + 25. Kg1- h1 Since the d-p awn is do omed any­how , ther e 's no sense in putt ing the bi shop en prise as well: after 25 Bd4 , Euwe would have cont inued 25 •. R:d 5 26 B:c 5 R:d 2 27 B: e7 + K: e7 28 fe Be4, which draws ; or [62] 26 fe+ Ke6 27 B:c S R:d 2 28 B:e 7 K:e7, and Bl ack can st ill draw, even though he is the exchange down. 25 . 26. f4 : eS + Rd8:d 5 Kf6-e6 Having recovered his piec e , White now at tacks the expos ed king ; however , he encount ers st rateg ica l di ffi cul ti es in de­ve lop ing his attack . The king is surrounded by its own piec es , which di sp lay a sharp tendency to counteratta ck at the first avail able opportu nit y. The king als o has many more open squares about him than would be the case if White were at tack ing the cas ­tl ed �os it ion. And finally, wit h White s king tucked away at h1, his own fi rst rank has becom e weak . None the le ss, White st ill has one str ong trump : the oppos ite­colo red bi shops , which normall y ensure an advantage to the at tack ­ing si de . It may have been this chance that White faile d fu ll y to explo it. 27. Qd2- gS Ke6 -d7 Bl ack would find himse lf en­snared after 27 .. Qc2 28 Rac1, si nce he is not rea ll y threate n­ing the bi shop : 28 .• Q:b 2? 29 Qf6+ and 30 e6+. 28. Ra1-c1 28 a4 , to exploit his str ate­gic advantage {the darks quare bi­shop ) wo uld have been st ronger , and po ssi bly dec is ive : his oppo­nent would have had to oppos e his ro ok . After 28 a4 , Black wou ld be practi cal ly forced to gi ve up the exchange ; he would get a sec­ond pawn for it , but then the at­tack of the que en and two rooks would have bec ome fi erce indeed : for example , 28 a4 Re6 29 Ba3 Qc4 30 Bd6 Re :d 6 31 ed R:d 6 32 Rad1 ; or 28 •• Re :e S 29 B:e 5 R:e S 30 Rac1 . 28. 29 .

Now he could try 31 R:f 5 �f 32 Qg8, but afte r 32 •. Qc6 ., this leads to a per­pet ual . 31. Qg5-h4 a7- a5 At this po int I began to sus­pect that Black had st arted to pl ay for the win. Having det ermined that 32 Q:h 7 ab 33 Q: f7+ was si m­pl y bad for me, I dec ided on one last at tack ing try: to bring the bi shop via e1 to g3 , creat ing a threat to c7 . 32 . Bb4-e1 33 .

Rf 1: fS All of the commentators gave this move an exc lamat ion mark , si nce it was by now White 's only means of fo rc ing a draw. Neve r­thel ess , I fee l bound to admit to the reader that I sacrif ice d more from ins pirat ion than from calcu­lati on. 35 •• gf 36 Rc7+ Ke8 37 Rc8+ appeared to me to be very dangero us for Black , for ins tance : 37 .• Kd7 38 Qd8+ Ke6 39 Qe8+ Kf6 [63] 40 Qh8+ Ke6 41 Re8+ Kd7 42 Rd8+ Kc6 43 Qh6+ Re6 44 Qc1+ ReS 45 Rc8+ Kd7 46 R:c 5. Later it was shown that not al l of Black 's moves in this li ne were forc ed, and that wit h exac t pl ay he could draw . Had Euwe taken the rook , there would have been no practi ca l reas on why he should lo se, si nce this variat ion would li e, for the most part , beyond the time con­trol ; however , he chose the more natura l contin uation. 35 . Re4 :h4 For a moment , I forgot that Black 's queen had moved to a6 , at tack ing the square f1, and very near ly went in for 36 R: dS+ Ke6 37 ReS +? ? Kf6 38 Rf1+. Do not imag ine , dear reader , that the grandmaste rs are spotless crea­tures ; they too , get int o ti me­tr ouble ; someti mes they fail to calculate a variati on compl etely; and occasio nall y, they even bl un­der ... 36 .

Kf6 -g5 but there was no furthe r play , si nce after 42 Rd 5+ and 43 R: aS the DRAW is obvious . 40. Gligoric-Szabo (Ruy Lopez) The pr ime cons iderat ion in one's cho ice of an open ing pl an shou ld be the harmonious devel­opment of the pie ces, but some­times we forget about the deve l­opment of the queen. Si nce the queen is , after al l, the most impor tant and the most valuable of the pi eces , the success of the whole pi ece co nf igurat ion may depe nd on how we ll the queen pl ays its part . In some openings , the move •. cS is important not only as a means of at tacki ng the enemy pawn center , but also in order to give the queen an exit to c7, b6 or aS . This app li es es­peci all y to systems in which the bis hop is develo ped to e7 , thus bl ocking the queen 's other di a­gonal: for exampl e , the Ortho­dox Queen 's Gambit , the Chig o­rin Ruy Lopez , or the Cl ass ica l Variat ion of the French Defe nse . In the game Gl igor ic - Sz abo , the development of Black 's queen became the central theme of the open ing and midd legame str uggle: White mainta ined a cle ar advan­tage as long as the queen was re legated to the ei ghth rank, and found his game sl idi ng down­hill as soo n as the queen ob­tained some lebens raum. 1. e2-e 4 2.

To me , the lat ter see ms more natu­ral (cf. Game 70, Averbakh -Szabo ), si nce the bi shop is more act ive ly poste d, and the queen retai ns the opt ion of deve lopi ng on the d8 -h4 di agonal . 9. 10.

So he retreats the knight fi rst . Now the e-pawn is real ly threatened ; but Gl igor ic pro ceeds to re fute Bl ack 's ent ire open ing conf igu­rat ion by means of a pretty and or igi nal queen maneuver, unpinning his knight and prev ent ing Black from cas tl ing . 13.

But there is one si gnif icant piece weakne ss in his posi tion, and that is the queen , which is not developed , and has no good prospect of ever do ing so -­ something which White could have at tempte d to exploit with 15 c4 . Whethe r Bl ack takes or pushe s hi s pawn, 16 Be4 would be White 's repl y; and on 15 .. Bg6, White would have traded bis hop s and pro­cee ded wit h 17 Rdl.

After the trade , Black has the better of it , since the a- pawn is weak, and the pawns at eS and f4 hem in White 's bi ­shop .

In maj or tournament s, one must ration one 's strength, not for the individua l game, but for the entire event, taken as a whole. The history of chess ev­ ents - and that of many other sports as well - contains many [87] cases in which one of the parti­ cipants forged ahead at the out­ set, only to lose game af ter game towards the end (a nd not against his most powerful opponents, ei­ ther) , finishing far behind the winners .

Additio nally, White gains the valuable square dS for both bi shop and knight . Bl ack 's ret arde d deve lopment is due ch ief ly to the fac t that the pawn which is now nail ed to d7 cl oses the di agona l c8- h3 , which means that the bishop now can only ge t int o pl ay on b7 or a6 . But 9 .• b6 is not yet pl ay­ ab le ; fi rst the knight must be pl ayed to c6 . Thus , we can deduce that Bl ack 's next three move s wi ll be : 9 •• Nc 6, 10 •. b6 , and 11. . Bb 7. Bl ack 's queenside pi ece s can only reach the king si de by way of the square d8, which puts quite a cr imp on the ir maneuver­ abi li ty. The se are the po si t ive as pects of 9 d6 .

White 's tas k is there fore to as sai l the kings ide with might and mai n fo r as lo ng as the �awn at d6 st ands, depr iving Bla ck s kingsi de of the neces sary support of his queen­ si de piece s.

Naj ­ dorf was apparent ly of the same opinio n: before anything el se , he ai ms to shore up the key po int g6 . (A note here : White 's at tack wou ld co ngeal very quickl y if he li mited his sacr ifice to the ex­ chan�e: 18 Q: a1 +? Qf6 19 N: g6+ Kg7 .) 17 . 18. g4: f5!

The si mple 20 Nf4 , sett ing up such fears ome threat s as 21 NhS+ , 21 QhS and 21 Rg 1, se ems more ap­ pea li ng , yet Euwe di dn't pl ay it. Why? To put it si mply, Euwe did not want to gi ve his opp onent a cho ic e. White 's 20 N:e 4 force s mat te rs : by depr iving Bla ck 's queen of the square c3, it eli m­ inat es the vari at io n 20 Nf4 Q c3 + 21 Kf l -- al though , in my op in­ ion , th is wou ld on ly impr ove White 's posi t io n.

Each grand­ maste r ha s his own styl e, wit h its stre ngths and weakne ss es . 20.

Ng6 -f 4 Bl ac k needs only another move or two to st abi li ze his positio n and es cape with his extra rook , but the se must be good moves . Thus , 22 ..

This game was typic al fro m that st andpo int , but a rarit y none theless . Averbakh chose a pl an lead ing to the cre atio n of a queens ide pa ss ed pawn.

White has his counte rchance s: a queens ide pawn maj or ity and the d-f il e . How many si mi lar games have been drawn becau se of inexac t play! Smys lov, however, manages such endings wit h an iron hand . His plan may be divided in­to the fol lowing phas es: 1.

Taimanov-Geller (King 's Indian) Perusal of this meaty game wi ll acquaint the reader with two str ategic ide as . As a resul t of the openin g Bl ack obtains the pawn config urat ion c5-d6-e5 ver­sus c4- d5-e4 ; this ensure s White greater freedo m to maneuver with­in his own li nes , si nce he has three ranks , while Bl ack has only two . Th is is an abst rac t advan­tage , of course , but it is the mas ter 's tas k to render it con­crete -- that is, to fi nd a pla n where in this wi ll prove usef ul. It is ins truct ive to watch as Taimanov practi call y cle ars his first three ranks of pawns en­ti re ly, enabli ng him to trans­fer his for ces eas il y from one wing to the other , while most of Bl ack 's pi ece s find thems el ves jo stli ng one another on the sev­enth rank , and esp ec ial ly on the ei ghth . And the second idea : White doub­les his rooks on the b- fil e , but cannot turn this to acco unt , si nce al l the good invasio n squares are covered by Bla ck 's minor pie ces . White therefore sti rs up some play on the other wing ; harml ess in itself, this pl ay leads to the exchange of a few pi ece s and draws the minor pi eces away from the b-fil e , thus allo wing White 's rooks to invade at b7 and con­cl ude the game wit hin a few moves. 1. d2-d 4 2. c2- c4 3.

White , how­ever , calmly retreat s his knight to f3 , obta ining maximum re sults .

In the fo llo wing phase , Whit e tri ed to cash in his init iat ive in the center and kings ide for a mat ing attack , invent ing a remarkable combination which sacrif iced a pawn, a roo k, and the exchange ­which Black neutrali zed by ex­changing off the enemy knight . A series of exchanges fo ll owed , which laid bare the def ic ienci es of Resh evsky 's pawn-push ing . Queens plus oppo sit e-co lor ed bis hops usual ly means a very sharp fi ght . In the game 's con­cluding phase Bl ack kept up his mat ing attack until the very last move , unwilli ng to trade queens anywhere except at b2 , which would have been hope less for Whit e. Even after all this , it still se emed as thoug h Black might not get his win . He found it , howev­er, by means of a joi nt maneuver by queen , bis hop and pawn that left the white pi eces in a state of abso lute zugzwang . 1. d2 -d4 2. c2 -c4 3. g2 -g 3 4. Bf 1-g2 S. Nb1-c3 6.

Kd8 45 Qa 8+ Kc7 46 Qa 5+ Bb6 , when the queen is � prise and mate is threat ened at gl .

White doe s not want to gi ve up his knight for Bl ack 's bi shop ei­ ther , si nce tha t bis hop is ham­ pered by its own pawns . Howev er , Bl ack 's next move puts a lo ng­ ti me cr imp on the white b-pa wn' s [186 ] advance. 14 . a7-a5 In order to preve nt the mino ­ rit y at tack , the pawn se parates fro m its base and becom es a tar­ get itse lf. So meti mes it happe ns that such a pawn draws a st r ing of bl ack pawns after it , li ke a need le pull ing thread ; in the pre se nt si tuati on , howe ver , Av­ erb akh is n't concerned with it s defense yet . What he has accom pli shed is that Whit e must now set about reg roup ing his pi eces to ward a new goal (a s­ sa il ing the a-p awn) ; Bl ack uses this ti me to be the fi rst to cr eate threa ts on the kings ide . 15 .

Shou ld Whit e have to advance his gor h-p awn, only then shou ld Bl ack br ing in hi s pawns . The succ ess of such an oper at ion depends upon the concrete pe­ cu li ariti es of the pos ition.

Taimanov-G iigoric (Sicilian Defense) The sacrifi ce of a pawn for the ini ti at ive is one of the most comple x prob lems of chess str ategy -- and perhaps of its psy cho l ogy as we ll. The pos it ions that oc cur as the re su lt of a sacr if ice are so var ied that no gener al iz at ions can po ssi bl y be made . So me grandmasters , pos ses­ si ng the facu lt y of quick cal ­ cu lat ion, not inf req uent ly gi ve up a pawn or two si mply to al ter the nature and balance of a po­ si ti on , even if thi s is perhaps not in the ir favor . I don' t think this manner of pla ying has much of a futu re . I myse lf have sacr ifi ce d , al l to ld, sev eral do ze n pawns , but st ill I thi nk that the mast er who sacrifi ces a pawn ought to have at least a genera l idea of the nature of the init iat ive he wi ll thereb y ob tai n , and what sort of game wi ll ensue . Once in a whi le , a pawn mus t be gi ven up , or even an exchange or a pi ece , aga inst one 's wi ll -­ the po int be ing that any other co urse le ads to a diffi cu lt po­ sit ion. Pla ying Whi te , Taim anov sacr if iced a pawn in the open­ ing , but obta ined no more of an initi at ive the reby than he might have obta ined by keep ing the same number of pawns as his op­ ponent . Throughout the game , White put hi mse lf thr ough ago­ nie s try ing to reg ain his pawn , but never quite succee ded ; even­ tuall y, Bl ack' s extra pawn went on to quee n. 1. e2 -e4 2. Ng 1-f 3 3. Bf1 -b5+ c7- c5 d7 -d6 The exchange of li ght square bis hop s on the fourth move is part of a far-seei ng st rat egic idea . Gl igoric ha s pl aced his pawns on dark square s, so Tai­ manov thinks that wit h the li ght square bi shop gone Black wi ll fi nd it hard to mai nta in the po sit ional ba lance .

The abil ity to make exc ept ionall y obj ect ive assess­ ment s of event s as they are oc­ curr ing is one of Taimanov 's out st anding traits --- a trait to be en vie d , and certai nly imitated as we ll.

Smyslov-Euwe (Reti Opening) Sacrific ing a pawn in order to se ize an open li ne in the center is one of the ol de st str ategic ideas known : it may be fo und in the cl assi cal games of Gre co , Morphy, Anders se n, Chigor in , Spie lmann and Al ekhine . Occas io nally, a pawn is � iven up to obtain a li ne fo r a b1sh op , the mo st obvious example be ing the Danis h Gambit : 1 e4 eS 2 d4 ed 3 c3 de 4 Bc4 cb 5 B:b 2. The mo st promis ing sacrifi ce s, how­ ever , are those whi ch open li ne s fo r the rooks , esp ecial ly when this invo lve s a di rect atta ck on the king . Our foreb ear s knew of another Muz io Gambit be si des the usual one , ca ll ed the "Doub le ( or ''Wi ld ") Muz io" : 1 e4 eS 2 f4 ef 3 Nf3 gS 4 Bc4 g4 5 0·0 gf 6 B: f7 + K: f7 7 Q:f 3, whic h is occ asio nal ly encounte red even to day . Of co urse, mast ers and grandmaster s take a rather skept ical att it ude toward such pl ay , but it has a siz ab le fol­ lowing among pl ayers of midd l ing st reng th . For example , this gam· bit was a mo st fears ome weapon in the hands of a Mosco w first ­ cate g ory p layer , Vo lodya Smir­ nov (Whos e unti me ly passi ng we al l mour n) , in school and col lege to urnaments , where he empl oyed his own analy ses and var iat io ns . But where pieces and pawns were fo rmer ly sacrif iced on the seco nd or thir d move , nowadays such ear ly skirmishi ng s in the center are avoi ded . It 's cer­ tain ly not beca use pl ayer s fear ris k -- in plai n term s , the King 's Ind ian is a gre ater ris k for Black than the King 's Gam­ bit for White . Never the le ss , not one of us is afraid to pl ay the King 's Ind ian , while the advo­ cate s of the King's Gambit grow fewer and fewer , as do tho se of the Sco tch , It al ian and Vi enna Games. The prob lem with all these openin � s is that after a short fig ht 1n the ce nte r, the pawn st ructure si mplifi es, and the fi ght which follo ws bec omes f lat and feat urel es s. Pl ayers of our day know how to sacrifice a pawn or a pi ece as we ll as Morphy or Andersse n di d; but it is a char­ ac teris ti c of the pre sent st ate of the art that sacrifices must be vos tponed whi le shie ldi ng one s combinati ve yearnings be· hi nd a mask of po si t iona l pl ay . The Smys lo v - Euwe game , fil le d with combi nat ive ideas that flo w or ganica ll y fro m the pos iti on , de serve s to be counted among the fi ne st examples of the art of chess . 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Af­ ter 12 .• Re8 13 de de is pos si­ ble , when the bl ack roo k even­ tual ly goes to the d- fil e . But after thi s move it wou ld make no sense at all for White to pla y eit her 13 d5 (while the bi shop sti ll st and s on c8 ) or 13 de (s ince the rook is al ready on the d- file) . So inste ad White co nt inue s the trad it io nal knight 's to ur , from b1 via d2 and f1 to g3 or e3 . 13 . Nd2 -f1 d6 -d5 ! And here is the nove lt y Kere s pre pared . The pos iti on th is cre­ ates cannot be exhaust ive ly an­ aly zed , si nce every move gi ve s ris e to three or fo ur dif fe rent po ssi bi li ti es, none worse than any ot her.

Su ch a ca lculat ion co uld pro bab ly be perfo rmed on ly by a computer - but a co mputer doe s no t pos se ss intuit ion. If we try to evaluate the po­ sit ion on the bas is of gene ral pr inci ples , we con c lude that White has good atta ck ing chance s: bot h his bis ho ps , bot h his knight s, and his que en can be mobil iz ed quickly to the battle­ field, whil e the rook hin der s the bl ack king's fli ght. There are on ly two tac ti cal co unt er­ chances for Bl ack that we can see : his que en at tack s the bi shop on c2 , and his rook may even­ tuall y thre aten the whi te queen . There fo re , th ere has to be a li ne White can pla y that wi ll gi ve the se po ssi bi li ti es co n­ crete expre ss ion. In that case , why doe s 12 ..

Knowing be fo rehand what li ne [235] was to be pl ayed , he set Bole­ sl avsk y the sort of prob le m that wou ld be very diffi cul t to so lve over the board .

Many of Aver bakh 's creat ions are very logi cal and co ns is ten t beca use he is such a great autho ri ty on , and enth us iast of , the endgame .

We know the knight is st ro ng : a) when the pawns are fi xed , b) when it has poi nt s of sup port , and c) when the enemy pawn s are on squares of the same col or as his bis hop . Aver bakh achi eve s all of th is by means of so me fi ne maneuve rs , le aving Naj dorf in co mpl et e zug ­ zwang . 1. c2 -c4 2. Ng 1-f3 3. g2-g3 4. Bf1-g2 5. 0-0 6. d2-d 4 7. Nb 1- c3 8.

I do not thin k tha t such a weakening wou ld have had very much of an effect on the overa ll pawn mas s, had White only take n the st atus of th is pawn (a t c4) into acc ount when making his fur ther pla ns , and not al­ lo wed Bl ack to at tack it unim­ pe ded . Bl ack' s knight wi ll now try to get to aS via c6 , which White shou ld end eavor to meet by the ti me ly po sti ng of his knight to b3 . Pl ay could proceed approx­ imate ly as fol lo ws : 9 •• Nc 6 10 Nd 2 NaS 11 B:b 7 N:b 7 12 Nb3 . Wh ite now pl ans an immed iate advance of his a- pawn to a4 and aS , thus for c ing Bl ack to pl ay •. a7- a5 himse lf, which dep r ive s his knight of that square . Shou ld the knight then tr y for d6 , it woul d be me t [243] by the very pawn it was tr yir .� to at tack , advanc ing fro m c� to cS . 9. 10. Nf3-e5 11 . Bg2 :b 7 12 .

White 's only chance is an at­ tack on the weak pawn at b6 , but thi s is il lusor y , si nce it can alw ays advanc e to bS , and the knight on c4 prote cts it anyway . Of co urse , Bl ack cannot ho ld on to all the advan tages his �o­ si t ion co ntai ns , but he doe sn t need them all in order to wi n.

Heavy-p ie ce fig hting fo r an iso lated pawn is one of the ce n­ tral ele ment s of pos it ional pl ay . Much more is invo lved than the si mple for mula :" White at tack8 twi ce , Bl ack def ends twice - and a draw is the out co me" . Woven int o the str ugg le are such mo­ tifs as : pi nning the is o late d pawn (s hou ld the hea vy pi eces def end it from beh ind) , a sud ­ den swi tch to an at tack on the ki ng , or an at tempt to occ upy the sev enth rank at so me poi nt when the heavy pi eces are ti ed to the de fense of the isola te d pawn . Isol ate d pawn endi ng s were pl ayed wit h great sk ill by the cl assi ci sts Lasker , Capab lanca and Rubinstei n.

The move g4-g5 is intere st ing from a ps ycho logi cal sta ndpo int .

The rook had to be brought to e6, when it tur ns out that exch anging rooks re­ sults in a king and pawn endgame that Bl ack can just barel y draw : 39 •. Re 7 40 Kg3 Re6 41 R:e 6 fe 42 Kh4 Kg6 43 f4 h6 . If White do es not take on e6 , then Bl ack pl ays •. h7- h6 ; and if White ans ­ we rs 39 .. Re 7 wit h 40 Rh6 , then 40 .. Re 5 41 R:h S Kg 6.

Advanc ing thi s pawn gave Whit e 's ki ng the square g4 and shorte ned the range of his own rook enough to gi ve White suffi c ie nt basi s for a real wi nning atte mpt . Wit h the bl ack pawn at h5 , I do not be l ieve a win wou ld have been pos si ble . If, for ins tance, White sets up this po sitio n: Kf5 , Rb7 , and pawns at f4 , e5 and g5 , wi th the threat of e5- e6 , then Bl ack put s his roo k on the e-fi le, which renders the pawn advance unp layab le , and Whit e's ki ng has no move eit her. 45 .

The winning me­ thod , dis c ove red by Gl igoric in act ua l pl ay , is not only pre tt y and lo g ica ll y cons iste nt , but a valuable add itio n to the o­ ry as we ll. Reach ing the fi nal pos it ion wi ll requir e White to advance his pawn fr om e5 to e6 with his roo k on the se venth rank , but this is no t immed ia te ly pl ay­ ab le , Gl igoric 's pl an to make it so may be di vided into the fo llo wing st ages : 1) induc e the bl ack h-pa wn to advanc e, and then cap ture it ; 2) br ing his own rook to d1 and dr ive the enemy rook fro m the e-f il e ; 3) carry out the fi nal maneu­ ver by pus hin g the f-pa wn to f5 and the e-pa wn to e6 wi th the support of the ki ng and rook . 49 . f2-f 4 h4-h3 It was noted in the fi rst ed­ itio n of thi s bo ok that Bl ack advanc ed this pawn to h3 in vie w of the threat of 50 Kg4 , si nce the white kin g co uld now cap ­ ture the h-pa wn while his f- pawn is on f4 : 50 Kg4 Rg 1+ 51 K:h 4 Rh1+ 52 Kg4 R:h 6 53 gh+ K:h 6 54 f5, when the pawn end ing is won for White . But as Or lov , an amat eur fro m Leningr ad , has po int ed out , this is not so : the end ing is ad raw ! Bl ack co nt inue s 54 •. Kg 7 55 Kg5 f6 + 56 ef + Kf 7 . He also no tes that the text move (4 9 .. h3 ) is necessa ry , but for a dif fe rent re aso n : 50 Kg4 Rg 1+ 51 Kh3 ! Rh1+ 52 Kg2 , which wins the pawn . 50 . Kf5-g 4 51. Kg4-f3 52 . Kf 3-g3 53.

As a mat ter of fact, cou ldn 't Bl ack cut off the white ki ng on the h- fil e permanent ly? No , be ­ cause after 60 Rf6 Kg 7 61 Kh3 Rg 1 62 Ra6 the threat to advance the e-p awn (w it h the ki ng at h5 and the rook at a7 ) would forc e Bl ack' s rook off the g-f il e . 60. Rh6- f6 61 .

Kotov-G iigoric (King's Indian) In the str uggle that is ches s, the bl ockade is no t just an im­ por tant te chnique , but als o one of the el ement s in the st rat eg ic pl an. The method s for dea li ng wit h any enemy pi ece may be ranked in desc ending value as follo ws : capture (o r el imina­ ti on ) , exchange , att ack , blo ck­ ade . The at tacked pi ece may be defe nded in any of se vera l ways : re tr eat is the simpl es t, but it may also be shie lded , or the at­ tackin g piece may be captured . The idea beh ind the bl ockade is fi rst to depr ive the target piece of its mobi lit y bef ore actu all y atta ck ing it . In the mo st genera l sense , a blo ckade may be emp lo yed aga ins t any pi ece , inc lud ing the king , but when we sp eak of the bl ock­ ade in prac ti cal ter ms , genera ll y it is in ref er ence to pawns . They are the eas ie st to bl ockade , and the mo st dange rous pi eces when set in motio n. Which piece s be st fill the role of bl ockader ? Firs t and fo remost , of course , the knight , si nce whil e it blo cks the path of the pawn it also at tacks the sq uare s di agonal ly behind it . The bis hop is also useful for this purpo se , si nce it can pre­ vent the advance of several pawns si mul tane ous ly. One may also bl ockade a pawn with a pawn � but that is a double­ edged weapon , si nce the blo ck­ ad ing pawn bec ome s bl ockaded its elf . The se are the bl ockade 's si m­ plest facet s; the real ity of chess is a gre at deal more com­ pli cated . In the Kotov - Gl igo­ ri c game , Bl ack succeeded in maintai ni ng a bl ockade of a co n­ si dera ble le ngth of pawn chai n, thereby severe ly re stricti ng , not only the pa wns, but the pieces too . Natura ll y, Gl igori c di d no t achi eve all thi s for no thing : it cost him a great deal of though t-­ and two pawns . 1. 2. d2-d 4 c2-c4 Ng 8-f6 g7-g6 3. Nb 1-c3 4. e2-e 4 s. f2-f3 6.

Boleslavsky- Taimanov (Queen 's Indian Defense) Doe s White ge t the advanta ge fro m his rig ht to the fi rst move ? Every chess p layer asks himself that que st ion, and the answer is not eas il y disco vered . One is fo rc efu ll y remind ed in th is co nnec tio n of Vs evolod Rau­ zer , one of our mo st noted mas­ ter- theo re ti c ians , whose motto was, "1 e2-e 4! , and Whit e wins ". He was probab ly jo king when he said that , but ever y jo ke con­ tains its share of trut h . This co nvi ctio n that moving the king ' s pawn fi rst gave White the be tter of it , while 1 d2-d 4 led only to a draw , inspi red Rauzer to work out amaz ing ly deep and fo rceful atta ck ing syste ms in a number of open ings : the Si ci­ lia n, French, Ruy and Caro-K ann , and many oth ers . Later , of cou rse , it deve lo ped tha t many of his (291] wins owed le ss to the obj ec ti ve st reng th of his 1 e2-e4 than to Rauzer 's own cr eati ve tale nt , the excep ti ona ll y lo gi cal pat­ ter n of his thinking , and the accuracy of his ca lculati ons . Rauzer 's At tacks and Var iat ions li ve on, and are stil l emp loyed to this day , even though it is po ssi ble fo r Bl ack to defe nd him­ se lf suc cessf ull y agains t them. So workin g up for c ing li nes for use in the openi ng battle , a fe ar some weapon in the hands of such pl ayer s as Morphy , Chigori n , Pi ll sbury , Alek hine , Fine and Botvinnik , is a method that works equall y we ll fo r White or Bl ack. The pl ayer who use s a prepared fo rc ing li ne may very we ll run into a fo rced re fut ation, as in­ deed happened in some game s from the pre se nt tournament . There is no pla yer, past or pre sent , who has neve r made a mis take - an ax iom that ho lds ju st as true fo r home analys is as it does for over- the -b oard pl ay. Which, in turn , means that one cann ot , a s a rule, gai n the advanta ge this way in the ope ni ng . So there exi sts a dif fer ent concept of open ing st rategy , which may br iefl y be summar iz ed as follo ws : that it is not nec­ es sary to make the very be st moves - on ly good ones . This was the creat ive atti­ tude of Lask er and Capab lanca , for exampl e, and it is Smys lov 's too . The advantage of the open­ ing , in this ca se, is under sto od to be the ri ght to choose a sys ­ tem of deve lo pment more suited to the White pl ayer 's taste , and which gi ve s him the grea test pos­ si ble li bert y to express his creat ive ab ilit y. Sta tis tics -a sound appr oach to the st udy of mas s phenomena show that White 's open ing advan­ tage is qui te real . In the var­ ious eras of histo ry , in every st rong tournament fo r which rec­ or ds were kept , White he ld a per­ sist ent edge in the number of wins . This advantage of White 's shou ld be cons idered as a te n­ dency , which mani fests itself in the co ur se of dozens or hun­ dreds of games, but which has no bear ing on the outcome of any part icular game . It wou ld be tr emendous ly int ere sti ng to examine th is te ndency in hi stori­ ca l cr oss-secti on : has the per­ ce ntage of game s won by Whi te increased or decre ase d by co m­ pariso n wit h what it was , say , 20, 50 or 100 years ago? One pecul iar fea ture shou ld be noted : the st ronger the to urnament , the weaker the inf luence of the ad­ vantage of the fi rst move . As exampl es to demons trate this , one may ci te the 1948 Wor ld 's Cham­ pio nship Match-Tou rnament , the 1951 World 's Championship Match (i n which White won fo ur games and Bl ack si x) , and a few ot her event s. Does this mean that even­ tuall y the ri ght of the fi rst move wi ll gi ve no advantage at al l? Time wi ll te ll .•• In this game , the re ader wi ll fi nd a sample of Bo les lavsky's we ll -pre pared and accura te ly­ ca lculated opening pl ay , follo wed by a natura l trans it ion int o a combin at ive midd le st age , and then an intere st ing endgame which is a win fo r Whi te . In conc lu­ sio n, we have a witty counter­ combinatio n by Taimanov . 1. d2-d 4 2. c2-c4 3. Ng1-f3 Ng 8-f6 e7 -e6 The fi rst of White 's "mere ly good" moves . 3 Nc3 is univers all y co ns idered "best" . 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. g2 -g3 Bf 1-g 2 o-o Nb1-c3 b7 -b6 Bc 8-b7 Bf 8-e7 0-0 Nf6-e4 In co ntrast to the King 's In­ di an , where the pl acement of the white e- pawn makes no diff erence to Bl ack , in the Queen' s Indian Bl ack has to keep cl ose watch on the e4 square . The diffe rence is eas ily exp la ined : in the King 's Ind ian , Blac k pl aces his center pawns on d6 and e5, leaving his queen 's bi shop the excel lent di­ agona l c8 -h3 to work on , where­ as her� the queen 's bi shop is deve lo ped to b7 , wit h a diff er ­ ent workin g di agonal , a8-h1 . Con­ se quent ly , it fo llo ws that the fewer pawns st and in the way from b7 to £3, the better Bl ack' s prospec ts will be . The next phase of the game co uld be headed , "The Bat tle For e2-e 4" , and it is Bo­ les lav sky who come s out the vic[292] to r. Unl ike Taima nov , he doe s not fo rget his ot her opt io n, that of shutt ing the fi anche t­ to ed bi shop out wit h d4-d5 . 8. Qd1-c2 Ne 4 :c 3 9. Qc2 :c 3 Whit e 's sec ond and third "mere ly good" move s. St ubborn at tempts to sec ure an advantage by means of 8 Bd2 or 9 be are still be ing tried - al though the latt er move does encounter the powerful rej oi nder 9 .• Nc6 (cf . Naj dor f - Averbakh ). 9. f7-f5 Opinions are sharp ly di vided over this fashi onable move . It is enough to no te that some con­ si der it to be a def ens ive move ; other s, att acking . The author po ss es ses a rather li mited knowledge of the Queen 's Ind ian , and al though 9 •• f5 di d occur in the third and las t en­ co unter between the prev ious and the pre sen t Wor ld Champions (Am­ st erdam 1938 , Al ekhine - Botvi n­ nik) , it woul d se em to me that Keres is more co rrec t in pref er­ ring the unhurrie d transfer of this bi shop to a be tt er square wit h 9 .. Be4 . In this opening fo rmat ion, the f-p awn pr obab ly be longs at f7 : the pawns at d7 , e6 and f5 overl oad the di agonal c8 -h3 . 10 . b2 -b3 11. Bc 1- b2 Be 7-f6 Nb8-� Of co urs e, Bl ack unders tands that the knight doe s not be lo ng at c6 ; he is mere ly us ing that square as a spr ingboard to bring the knight to the king 's wing . Howeve r, this costs Black ano­ ther move , which enhances White 's initi al advantage . Wit h his advantage in ti me , White method ica ll y prepa res , and then carr ie s out , the impor­ tant push d4- d5 , cutt ing the bl ack bis hop 's mobili ty to ni l. 12. Ra1-d1 13.

Meanwhile , White co uld pl ay Rab1 and b4 , et c. ; and wit h his bis hop working on the di agona l h1-a 8 , he co ul d work up some ser ious threa ts to Bl ack 's queen 's wing . Dur ing al l this , practi ca ll y the on ly thing the knight on d4 would accom pl is h would be to co ver the weak pawn on d3 fro m fro ntal at tacks al ong the d- fi le. This is why, ins tead of the "st rateg ic" •• Nd4 , Bl ack se lects the co mbinat ive .. Rfd8 , ai ming di rec tly at the d-p awn . 15. Be3 :c 5 16 . d3 -d4 17. Qd 1-e2 Nc6-e5 Ne5:c 4 Nc4-d6 A series of subt le change s has occurr ed . Whit e 's queen 's bi shop has migrat ed to cS, where it cramps Bl ack 's acti vi ti es . Whit e 's d- pawn has moved up a sq uare , but it rema ins ju st as isol ated , and ther efo re ju st as weak , as it was bef ore . But is it rea ll y weak ? It is common pract ice to talk about [303] an iso lated pawn's sho rtco ming s and negl ect its po si ti ve aspect s. One such asp ect is the absence of pawns on the ne ighboring fil es , which is a po int for the "is olate d " si de , as lo ng as he can bring his maj or pi eces to those fi les . And so it is here : the ab sence of pawns on the c- and e-fil es is cl ear ly not favo rable to Bl ack. The queen , for example , sta nds quite unc omforta bly at c7 , and the far ­ reaching power of White 's bi­ shops is also making itself fe lt. Under the se ci rcumstan ces , Bl ack take s the only proper decis ion : to at tack and eli minate the d­ pawn supp ort ing White 's center as quic kly as he can . 18. 19 . 20. a2 -a4 a4-a5 a5-a 6 e7 -e6 Nd6-f5 Nf6 -d5 Bl ack mis takenly st ops half­ way . 20 •• b6 wou ld have achieved both of Bl ack 's goals by dr iving the bis hop fro m c5 and el iminat­ ing the d-p awn .

However , the interm ed iary 22 NbS st rengthens the defe ns e, so perhaps Bl ack wou ld be better advi se d to take the other bishop : 21 .. bc , and after 22 Bg2 cd he has a str ong pass ed pawn . Then Bl ack 's pre s sure on the b- file, combined wit h the ad­ vance of hi s d- and e- pawns sup­ ported by his fi anche tt oed king ' s bi shop , would have assu red him even chance s, desp it e his sma ll materi al deficit .

P49J ZURI CH IN TERNATIONAL CH ESS TOURNAME NT, 1953 David Bronst ei n The book of a strong tour nament is mor e than ju st a games collecti on. When its pa rtici pa nt s are the wor ld ' s stro ngest players ... the tou mame n t as a wh ole represen ts a step forwar d in the devel opment of chess creativ ity. We may take as exa mp les of such touma ment s the ev ent s at Hasti ngs 18 95, St. Petersbur g 19 14, New York 1924, Moscow 1935, and Gr on ingen 19 46. Beyo nd doubt, Zur ich-Neuhausen 19 53 deserves a place among them . David Br onstein ventur ed this evaluation of Zuric h 19 53 ju st th ree years after the event , in the preface to the first Ru ssian editi on of this book. Sin ce that tim e the 210 games of the legendar y tournament have only grown in statur e. Mo st kn owle dgeable chess pl ayers now rate it the greatest tournamen t since World War II, and possibly the greatest tournament of all time. For over 25 years there was no subs tantia l account in Eng lish of this great tour name nt. In the 19 60s Jim Ma rfia, a talent ed ama teur player, became determ in ed to prov ide an auth oritati ve En glish tran slation of Br onstein's book, a task wh ich occupied him for several years . The comp lete record of the famou s Zu rich In terna tional Che ss Tournam ent, 1953, is avail able in Eng lish for the fi rst time. Held to determi ne a chal lenger for then World Champ ion Botvi nnik, Zu rich 19 53 att racted fifteen of the strong est pl ayers in the wo rld : SmY slov Geller Boleslavsky Bron stei n Na jdQr f Szabo Ke res Kotov Gl igoric Reshevsky Taim anov Euw e Pet rosi an Averbakh Stah lberg Al most all the games were hotly con test ed, an d ma ny are masterpie ces of the first rank. To mention Euwe -Smy slov (roun d 3) , Taim anov-Na jd orf (r ound 4, wi nner of a br illi ancy prize) , an d Keres-Reshevsky (r ound 11, one of the most reproduced and an alyzed games in che ss) , is ju st to touch the tip of the iceberg; there are literally doz ens of me morable, in novative game s in this volume, in cluding a subs tantia l por tion by the aut hor, on e of th� game's grea test players , wh o fin ished tied for seco nd with Keres and Resh evsky, beh in d the winn er Smy slov . This book fills a significant gap in the English -lan gu age library of in fluentia l chess tour na ment books. Advanced pl ayers, man y of whom ha ve known about the tournament for years, wi ll wa nt thi s book for the games alon e. Beg inning and in termed ia te pl ayers, concer ned mo re immediately with in stru ction, will find David Br onste in's annotat ions not only perceptive and thor ough, but also a veritable textbook on how to play the mi ddle game.

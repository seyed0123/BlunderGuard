Another important topic — the openings revolution of the 1970s-1980s — proved to be so extensive and interesting, that a separate, 6th volume, has had to be devoted to it In the previous volume I put forward the provocative suggestion that, in a match with Fischer, Karpov would have had real winning chances, and that the American champion de¬ clined to defend his tide as he was afraid of losing to an unfamiliar opponent — the leader of a new generation, a forceful professional, who had fully assimilated the lessons of his great prede¬ cessor. Now I will try to justify this suggestion, by imagining a possible scenario of the match and carefully studying those unique qualities of Karpov, which enabled him for almost a quarter of a century to be at the summit of chess or literally only a step away. This chapter turned out to be one of the longest in the entire series, which is not surprising: Karpov’s influence on the de¬ velopment of chess has been truly epochal — it was felt right to the end of the 20th century. But an enormous contribution has also been made by Korchnoi, a legendary player, who has been able to accomplish the seemingly impossible — conquer time. Contrary to all the impres¬ sions about age limits, this great match and tournament fighter reached his creative peak at the age of 47, surpassing the former champions Petrosian and Spassky. In the history of chess he is the only challenger to have played de facto three matches for the world crown, in one of which, Baguio (1978), he all but became world champion. And this when he was 20 years older than his opponent! After all, it appeared that the young Karpov, supported by the entire might of the Soviet ma¬ chine, simply had no equals: the older generation of top-class grandmasters had already left the stage, the middle generation had been ‘knocked out’ by the Second World War (and Fischer had ‘knocked out’ himself), and in the younger generation, for all its brilliance and professionalism, there was no star of champion-like magnitude. The only real intrigue in the mid-1970s appeared to be the Fischer-Karpov match, which would undoubtedly have given the development of chess a colossal impulse. When it collapsed, there was a temporary period of quiet and disap- 5 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors pointment But nature cannot endure empty spaces, and soon a vigorous attempt on the chess summit was made by Korchnoi, for which he was forced to leave the USSR, where he had been persecuted, and enlist the moral support of the West. His battles with Karpov, especially the match in Baguio, had a very great influence on all as¬ pects of the game — the purely chess aspect, off the board, and psychological. As it later tran¬ spired, this was the prelude to Karpov’s clashes with the leader of the next generation — the au¬ thor of these lines (the topic of Volume 7). But Korchnoi, after handing the ‘Olympic baton’ to me in our 1983 match, has continued to play successfully in tournaments and as a result has shown himself to be an exceptional example of competitive longevity. In this respect only Lasker and Smyslov can compare with him, but Korchnoi’s victories have been achieved in the ultra¬ intensive chess of the present day! All these matches for the world championship demanded serious research work Here not only were the fruits of the post-Fischer opening revolution reaped, but also the rapid advance¬ ment of chess thinking was continued, towards the present-day computer era... When analysing anew the games of Karpov and Korchnoi, and remembering the games al¬ ready examined of other champions and challengers, I began thinking about the role of intuition in the accomplishments of outstanding players. This question intrigued me: is this not the root of differences in playing styles? It turns out that the great masters can be arbitrarily divided into three groups. 1. Players with relatively poor intuition (of course, only by the standards of champions): Steinitz, Botvinnik, Euwe, Fischer... But they had qualities which compensated for their some¬ what straightforward play: erudition, logic, orderliness,’iron will and an extraordinary capacity for work. 2. Players with strong, at times phenomenal strategic intuition: Capablanca, Smyslov, Petro¬ sian, Spassky, Karpov... Of the challengers, perhaps only Rubinstein can be added to this group. All of them would find the best places for their pieces with staggering ease and accuracy. 3. Players with a strong specific intuition, operating in sharp situations where the material and positional equilibrium was disturbed: Lasker, Alekhine, Tal, Kasparov... And also Chigorin, Bronstein, Stein and Korchnoi, who in the early 1960s was called Tal in reverse’. Some may find this division questionable, but it is the fruit of a thorough study and compari¬ son of the games of the champions. Incidentally, when analysing the old games with a computer, I discovered that many intuitive decisions by the classics were correct and that far more mistakes were made in later analysis. This would seem to be a paradox: after all, when analysing there is no hurry and one can move the pieces. But the point is that at this moment the intuition which operates intensively during a game, in conditions of extreme tension and limited time, is switched off. Intuition truly is the tsarina of the chessboard! I should like to express my thanks to USSR Honoured Trainers Alexander Nikitint, Igor Zaitsev and Mark Dvoretsky, grandmasters Yuri Ra^uvaev, Yuri Dokhoian and Vladimir Belov, and master Alexander Shakarov, for assistance in the preparation of this volume forpublication. 6 CHAPTER ONE Viktor the Terrible Marathon Runner It is difficult to talk about a contemporary of mine, who has lived such a great, interesting and intensive life in chess. Just think - the first major successes of Viktor Lvovich Korchnoi (bom 23 March 1931) were achieved more than half a century ago! Many of those bom in the 1930s and 1940s have now given up play¬ ing, but even at the start of the 21st century Korchnoi continues to compete in tourna¬ ments, and the young can merely envy his energy, thirst for batde, and ability to give his all when playing. This chapter is fully comparable in size with some of the chapters devoted to world champions. Here it is a question not only of the unique length of Korchnoi’s chess career, but also of his rare inventiveness, and his tireless attempts to find something new in seemingly exhaustively studied positions. All his life he has been at the leading edge of chess thinking and he has made a valuable contribution to the development of the game. It was this fact that induced me to devote a large section to the original play of Viktor Lvovich, and to focus attention on his most important and vivid features. Korchnoi’s heritage is many-faceted — over the decades he has several times corrected and changed his style. But the main thing has in¬ variably remained his search for chess truth. Korchnoi has always been merciless both to himself, and to his opponents. Of course, this feature of his character has not added to his number of friends. But otherwise it is proba¬ bly impossible to seek the eternally elusive chess truth. One has to be prepared for every move being called into question, every deci¬ sion being fiercely criticised. One must look truth in the eye and not be afraid to come to any conclusions, even the most unprejudiced, if they reflect the real picture. Already in his youth Korchnoi had showed himself to be an unusual player. Most prefer to attack, and few like playing defensively, so to speak from the base line, patiently prepar¬ ing to launch a counterattack But that is the way Korchnoi played: provoking the enemy fire, accepting sacrifices and then masterfully exploiting the weaknesses arising in the enemy position. Back in the 1950s this extremely risky style gave him the widely held reputation of being a difficult, awkward opponent for any grandmaster, right up to the world champion. An amazing paradox: when, after passing hundreds of Korchnoi’s games through a Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors rigorous filter, I selected about forty of the most representative, it unexpectedly transpired that in the first twenty of them, covering the years 1954-1977, he had the black pieces! But if you think about it, this is fully in accordance with the character of his play. Such seemingly accidental coincidences merely confirm the overall trend. Child of the Blockade Korchnoi’s childhood was difficult and full of deprivation, like that of many children of the war years. Half a century later he was to write: 'Apparently I did not receive a proper Soviet upbringing in my family. It is most probable that my father paid the full price for this care¬ lessness — along with several hundred other poorly-armed volunteers, he died on Lake Ladoga in November 1941. This also applied to the remaining members of my father’s fam¬ ily, where I was brought up — they all died from hunger during the siege of Leningrad. But I remained, I survived.’ Viktor was able to study chess seriously only at the age of 13, when in the autumn of 1944 he joined the chess club at the Leningrad Pioneers Palace. At the time he also signed up for two more clubs — recitation and music, although it quickly transpired that he had nei¬ ther correct pronunciation, nor a piano that was essential for practising. But he already played chess quite well — a year earlier, soon after the partial breaking of the blockade, he had taken part in a junior tournament©, ap¬ parently after reading an announcement on the bomb-damaged wall of the Anichkov Pal¬ ace: 'Enrolment of schoolchildren to the Len¬ ingrad open championship takes place on Monday. Director of the chess club, A.Model.’ 'At Fontanka we could hear the thunder of artillery shelling, when Viktor and I sat down to play our first chess game,’ recalls his contempo¬ rary, the journalist Oleg Skuratov. My oppo¬ nent was a thin, dark-haired boy wearing a neat quilted jacket We were playing in the basement of the palace, and the cold was terrible, but the “hall” of the deserted bomb shelter seemed simply divine to us. I remember being im¬ pressed by the way my opponent accurately recorded the moves of our game in a school notebook, and the chess notation signs in¬ trigued me. As a result of this (as it genuinely appeared to me!) I lost a mysterious pawn end¬ game. With a face as long as a fiddle I went up to Model: “I lost!” “Against whom?” I again glanced at the notebook and read the name of my opponent: “Someone by the name of Korchnoi!” I said in vexation. The boy in the quilted jacket glanced angrily in my direction... for a long time he did not forgive me for these inadvertent little words “Someone by the name of’. At the age of 12 Viktor already had a heightened sense of dignity.’ His first books were Lasker’s manual and Tartakower’s work Osvobo^bdennye Sbakhmaty (Liberated Chess), and his first teachers were the masters Audrey Batuev and Abram Model. Then Korchnoi studied in the group of the subsequently well-known trainer Vladimir Zak (in 1946 the nine-year-old Boris Spassky came to him, and immediately became one of his favourite pupils) and within two years he was already participating in the USSR Junior Championship. After five rounds he was among the leaders, but then, after losing a game, he somehow went to pieces and in the end only shared llth-12th places, while first place was taken by his future implacable op¬ ponent Petrosian... But in the next two national junior champi¬ onships (1947 and 1948) Korchnoi was the winner, although in the second of these he had a difficult time. 'After losing in the first round, he so lost heart that he wrote a gloomy letter to his trainer Zak, in which he admitted that he did not believe in himself,’ testifies the writer Viktor Vasiliev. 'Only a reply by tele¬ gram from his mentor, angry and at the same time encouraging, forced him to take himself in hand.’ Many games from that period have been lost, but one episode that has been preserved 8 Viktor the Terrible is the amusing finish to a miniature, played between the 17-year-old Korchnoi and the 11- year-old Spassky (Leningrad 1948). 11...#94? (instead of the normal ll...JLg7) 12 £>d5!, and Black resigned, after noticing to his horror that after 12...Wxf3 13 ^xf6+ i?e7 14 £M5+ and gx£3 he loses a piece. The hopeless resistance could have been pro¬ longed after 12...4^8 13 ®xg4 ^xg4 14 h3 £ih6 15 fxe5 dxe5 16 Ag5+ <4>d7 17 ±£6 Sg8, but the distressed Boris no longer had the moral strength... David Bronstein remembers a difficult si¬ multaneous display with clocks that he gave against ten candidate masters in the autumn of 1948 in a Leningrad chess club: ‘Each played for himself, but beside one of the boards, peeping over Cherepkov’s shoul¬ der, I saw a young and lively face with bril¬ liant, clever eyes. The display lasted a long time — at least five hours. And at the very end, beside one board with a very interesting and complicated position, there were just three of us left. My main opponent was sitting calmly, but his voluntary consultant was fidgeting and literally piercing me with his glance. Some 15 minutes later Cherepkov offered me a draw and with a happy sigh of relief I agreed. And here Vitya Korchnoi (he was the consultant) leapt up from his chair, leaned across the chessboard and hurriedly, as if fearing that I might evaporate into thin air and disappear, with his inimitable pert voice that later became famous, exclaimed: “Didn’t you win? But you promised! Only 5-5!” But I did not become flustered and I calmly replied: “What do you mean! Who told you this? I was dreaming of 5-5. After all, these are players from a city with ancient traditions and a great chess culture.” And Korchnoi calmed down.’ This was the first meeting of two remarkable players, who since then have related to each other with invariable sympathy and respect After finishing school, having already de¬ cided to devote his life to chess, Korchnoi nevertheless entered the History Faculty of Leningrad University. ‘Student poverty was proverbial,’ he wrote later. ‘I myself remem¬ ber: in my pocket I had money either for a tram ticket, or for the cheapest cigarettes. And very rarely for a miserable student dinner.’ Viktor was very fond of history, but he was even more fond of chess and... card games (like, however, Lasker before him and Karpov after him). In the words of an eye-witness, ‘in the flat where many young chess players gath¬ ered, he could play chess or poker from morn¬ ing till evening, he would take a “time-out” when he had to go to the next round of the Leningrad Championship, and closer to mid¬ night he would again return and could play several hands of preference.’ Thanks to his rare independence and objec¬ tivity of thinking, Korchnoi enjoyed an indis¬ putable authority among Leningrad’s chess players: when, in the course of a tournament, some conflict arose, the participants would often turn not to the arbiters, but to Viktor, and his verdict would put an end to the matter. However, this independence also had its ad¬ verse side, T took every barrier head-on, and I had ridiculous confidence in myself/ Korchnoi admitted years later. He did not have any quali¬ fied help, but when towards the end of the 1940s grandmaster Tolush offered such help, ‘to make a master out of him’, he proudly re¬ plied: T myself will become a master!’ Which he soon did — after the Chigorin Memorial tour¬ nament (Leningrad 1951). But later, after seeing 9 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors how Tolush had been able to transform Spassky, he greatly regretted his refusal... As a result, although the indications were that Korchnoi was a highly talented and promising player, each new step forward cost him enormous effort. In his first USSR Championship semi-final (1950) he contrived to start with... 0 out of 7(!), but then he never¬ theless managed to pull himself together at the finish: +4=4. He finished the next semi-final (1951) with a plus score, and in 1952 he finally broke through to the final — where he imme¬ diately finished in an honourable sixth place, ahead of Bronstein, Smyslov and Keres! This was his first major success. According to Korchnoi himself, he achieved this success not thanks to his under¬ standing of the game, but thanks to intensive work at the board: 1 would be outplayed, but I would resist tenaciously, and since grand¬ masters are ordinary people (they also become tired, make mistakes, and get into time- trouble), I was quite often able to emerge un¬ scathed. In this tournament I played for the first time against world champion Botvinnik, and although the game ended in a draw, dur¬ ing analysis I realised how far I was from genuine chess wisdom. I ascertained that I had an insufficiently deep understanding of chess strategy. In addition, I didn’t like and didn’t know how to attack; defence was my natural element. This one-sided strategy was often exploited by my opponents... I realised that I had to diversify my style: to be able to attack and to fight for the initiative.’ Korchnoi also qualified fairly confidently for the final of the next, 21st USSR Champi¬ onship. In the semi-final (Vilnius 1953) Korchnoi won a remarkable game against Suetin. In a complex, multi-piece ending, he unexpectedly gave up both a pawn and the exchange with his 30th move, sharply activat¬ ing his forces and achieving a rapid turning point in the play. ‘Before this game for some reason it had not occurred to me,’ writes Vik¬ tor Lvovich, ‘that a sacrifice of material, even when forced, even when the queens are not on the board(!), can lead to the seizure of the initiative and the winning of the game... I had to reinterpret many of the impressions of chess that I had had up till then.’ The USSR Championship, which took place early in 1954 in Kiev, became a new and vivid landmark in Korchnoi’s biography. After beginning with a defeat against Suetin (in a risky ‘Accelerated Dragon5), he scored three wins and two draws — with Taimanov and Petrosian — and established himself in the leading group. In the seventh round he had Black against the experienced Semion Furman, Korchnoi’s future second and subse¬ quently Karpov’s long-standing trainer, who was half a point ahead of him. Furman’s first move was not a secret to anyone — 1 d4!? Since, as has already been said, the majority of the best and most characteristic games of the early and even the mature Korchnoi were played with the black pieces, his opening rep¬ ertoire is of particular interest. After 1 e4 he most often and successfully played the French Defence, but he also left his mark in the Sicil¬ ian, Alekhine, Pirc-Ufimtsev and Caro-Kann Defences, and in the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez (as will be described later). After 1 d4 for many years he constantly employed the dynamic Griinfeld Defence, and only in his middle age did he turn to more fundamental defences — the Nimzo-Indian and the Queen’s Indian. At that time the Griinfeld Defence allowed wide scope for creativity — White was only just probing for ways to retain hopes of an advan¬ tage. But the main thing was that Black’s stra¬ tegic plan in this opening fully corresponded with Korchnoi’s counterattacking style. Allow¬ ing White to create a strong pawn centre, he then does everything possible to undermine and destroy it, in the hope of exploiting the weaknesses that inevitably arise in the oppo¬ nent’s position. The following game with Furman, while not without its faults, gives a good illustration of this strategy. 10 Viktor the Terrible Game 1 S.Furman-V. Korchnoi 21st USSR Championship, Kiev 1954, 7th round Grunfeld Defence D92 1 d4 £if6 2 c4 g6 3 £ic3 d5 4 £if3 (or first 4 Jtf4 Jtg7 5 e3 and Scl — Volume 3, Game Nos.12 and 29) 4...jtg7 5 .&f4 0-0 6 Scl After the usual 6 e3 c5 7 dxc5 ®a5 White does not gain any advantage (Rauzer- Alatortsev, 7th USSR Championship, Moscow 1931; Levenfish-Botvinnik, 11th matchgame, Moscow/Leningrad 1937). ‘The idea of the variation with 6 flcl is to seize the c-file, control of which plays an im¬ portant role in the subsequent play; in addi¬ tion, the threat to the c7-pawn induces Black to take on c4, which is also of definite benefit to White/ (Furman). This variation became especially popular at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries. It need hardly be added that today it has been exhaustively studied. 6...dxc4 This is considered more reliable than 6...c5 7 dxc5 Jte6, as in Ragozin’s games with Botvinnik (8th matchgame, Leningrad 1940) and Mikenas (12th USSR Championship, Moscow 1940), or 7...dxc4 8 ®xd8 flxd8 9 e3 (9 e4!? £}a6 10 e5 Bronstein-Filip, Amsterdam Candidates 1956) 9...^a6 10 c6 bxc6 11 Jtxc4 £}d5 12 jte5 &Sb6 13 Ae2 f6 14 Jtg3 with a complicated ending, slighdy better for White (Korchnoi-Stein, 30th USSR Championship, Erevan 1962). 7 e3 Strengthening the d4-point.

Later I successfully played this against Karpov (1st matchgame. New York rapidplay 2002). 9 £ixd5 A seemingly natural exchange.

Retaining the bishop in the hope of quickly Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors completing his development and seizing the initiative. However, this does not succeed and the move in the game proves to be a loss of an important tempo. Since the mid-1980s the immediate 10 jtxc4 has been played, with the gambit idea 10...^xf4 11 Wf3! 10,..c5! A typically ‘Grunfeld’ undermining move, emphasising White’s backward development.

Apparently Furman was pinning all his hopes on the queen move, which creates threats against the knight at d5, the f7-point and the b7-pawn. 12.. .dxe3!? ‘The game enters a phase of wild complica¬ tions. After thinking for more than an hour, I rejected 12...e6 in view of 13 Wxbl (13...^b6 14 £kf7) 14 ±xd5.7 (Korchnoi).

However, the move in the game is sharper and more interesting. Either way, it becomes obvious that the well-known theoretician and White expert’ Furman has already lost the opening duel. By the 12th(!) move White has ended up in an unpleasant position and he is obliged to seek a way of maintaining the balance. It seems to me that this demonstrates the level of theo¬ retical development at that time. 13 J.xd5 e6 (a double attack, the bishop being unable to move on account of 14...#d2+) 14 ®xe6 #a5+ 15 Sc3 After 15 ^fefl fxe6 16 Jtxe6+ (16 jt£3 ^c6) 16.. .4.118 17 ®xe3 4tic6 (Korchnoi) Black has a serious initiative for the pawn; it is hard for White to bring his rook at hi into play and to safeguard his king. 15.. .fxe6 16 ±xe6+?! White continues to play for an attack and ends up in an inferior position. Instead of this he could have gone into a roughly equal end¬ ing: 16 Axb7 Jtxc3+ 17 H(xc3 Wb6 18 ®h3 exf2+ 19 <A)e2 ^d7 20 Wxb6 axb6 21 Jlxa8 2xa8.’ (Korchnoi).

After this fighting draw Korchnoi gained five successive wins and, with a score of 914 out of 12, was leading the tournament race! But then Yuri Averbakh, a participant in the recent Candidates tournament in Zurich, plucked up courage and surged ahead. In the final, 19th round, he had Black against Korchnoi... Years later Yuri Lvovich recalled: ‘Leading Korchnoi and Taimanov by 114 points, I was feeling very good-humoured, and I naively assumed that my opponent’s mood would be similar: all the same I could not be caught, and he was assured of a share of sec¬ ond place. After Korchnoi employed an im¬ provement, I should have realised that he was not at all peacefully inclined, but I was still in a placid mood and I simply could not summon up any fighting spirit, even when I realised that I was in a lost ending. However, unex¬ pectedly the spectators came to my aid. They were openly supporting the youngest competi¬ tor and were not afraid of loudly expressing their sympathy. And when I ended up in a critical position, from the gallery they began chanting in a whisper: “Averbakh, resign! Averbakh, resign!” This acted on me like the call of a battle trumpet, and, gritting my teeth, I began seeking the slightest saving chances. I set myself the objective of not losing before the time control on move 40, in order to ad¬ journ the game and not give pleasure to Korchnoi’s most zealous supporters. I fulfilled this minimum objective, by holding out to move 40, but my position remained cheerless. And here I was helped by... Korchnoi himself! Instead of adjourning the game, he decided to finish me off straight away, seeing as he still had time on his clock. But in the heat of the moment he missed a win... The game was ad¬ journed only on the 56th move and agreed drawn without being resumed.’ This is merely one of numerous episodes that reveal Korchnoi’s chess character. He did indeed earn general sympathy with his bold and versatile play, and he became one of the heroes of that championship: 1. Averbakh — 1414 out of 19; 2-3. Korchnoi and Taimanov — 13; 4-5. Lisitsyn and Petrosian — 1214; 6. Kholmov — 1014; 7-9. Furman, Nezhmetdi- nov and Suetin — 10, etc. Tn his person, Soviet chess has a talented 14 Viktor the Terrible representative with a distinctive style, a fully- fledged candidate for the grandmaster title. In his first appearances Korchnoi introduced himself as a player who was skilled in compli¬ cations and the calculation of sharp variations, but now, while retaining this valuable quality, he has shown that he can also play in classical positional style. Korchnoi is very young: dur¬ ing the tournament he was not yet 23. This also partly explains the unjustified risks which he took in certain games. And although he was sometimes able to win by these means, he should realise that this is an unreliable way of making further progress,’ Alexander Konstan- tinopolsky wrote in his concluding article. The fact that this success in the national championship was no accident was confirmed by Viktor a month later, in the first interna¬ tional tournament of his career in Bucharest (1954). Here he faced fierce rivalry from Rashid Nezhmetdinov, an experienced master from Kazan, who set a fast pace from the start Only after a win against Filip in the 12th round was Korchnoi able to catch the leader. But how difficult a win that was! ‘Genuine chess masterpieces are created when a resourceful and clever attack encoun¬ ters a fierce and inventive defence. Defending is considered a thankless task, although it has its romanticism,’ Korchnoi wrote in 1961. ‘But masters of defence (Steinitz, Lasker, Nimzo- witsch, Botvinnik, Petrosian) have made no less a contribution to chess history than play¬ ers of attacking style (Morphy, Anders sen, Alekhine, Tal, Geller). My chess tastes are re¬ vealed best of all by the following game.’ Game 2 M.Filip-V.Korchnoi Bucharest 1954, 12th round _Griinfeld Defence D86_ magin’s difficult variation, where Black first plays ...^c6 and develops his queenside. 8 £se2 £\c6 Now White retains his powerful centre and is bound to gain an advantage, but it is here that Black’s main hope is concealed: demon¬ strating the advantage demands active play (an axiom formulated long ago by Steinitz), and the opponent may give himself weaknesses — targets for a counterattack! 9 Jtg5!? ‘Since Black is not attacking the d4-point, White has the possibility of developing his bishop not at e3, as usual, but rather more actively,’ Korchnoi explains. A couple of months earlier, in the USSR Championship, Iilienthal played 9 0-0 against him (9 h4?! — Volume 3, Game No.61), and after the moves 9.. .®d7 (Korchnoi’s patent move; the stan¬ dard reply is 9...b6) 10 Aa3?! ^a5 11 JLd3 b6 12 &f4?I kbl 13 ®e2 fifd8 14 ladl e6 15 e5 c5! 16 dxc5 ®c7l 17 cxb6?l Wxe5 18 18fxe5 Jtxe5 19 ^e2 axb6 20 Acl Jtd5 Black accu¬ rately converted his advantage in the ending. 9.. .#d7 (Korchnoi is faithful to his move and is not in a hurry to play 9...4}a5, Kopylov- Simagin, 19th USSR Championship, Moscow 1951) 10 0-0 (10 Ifd2 c5!?) 10..Aa5 11 itd3 b6 12#d2 1 d4 2 c4 g6 3 ^c3 d5 4 cxd5 £xd5 5 e4 £lxc3 6 bxc3 ±g7 7 Ac4 0-0 One of Korchnoi’s bold experiments: in¬ stead of the usual move 7...c5 he employs Si- 12...2d8?!

Of course, such a prospect did not appeal to Korchnoi, and he preferred to eliminate the dangerous pawn. 20 J.b5? At first sight, the most natural move: both 21 <53xd5 and 21 e6 fxe6 22 4^xg6 are threat¬ ened. However, the bishop is diverted from the kingside, and therefore other ways should have been sought: 1) 20 Zhh5 We7 (20...1re6 21 f4) 21 £3f6+ ±xf6 22 exf6 We5 23 Wh4!

(Korchnoi suggested 22 Bfel, but 22...<§3e5! parries the attack: 23 flxe5 Jlf6 24 Sf5 Jtxg5 25 Bxf7 jtxh6 26 Bxb7 Jtxf4 with a roughly equal endgame) 22...hxg6 23 Jtxg6 Wei. Be¬ cause of this move Korchnoi considered the knight sacrifice to be premature, but after 24 Hfh5! White has a very strong attack: he is threatening Bfel, and Bd3-g3, and the ad¬ vance of the f-pawn. For example: a) 24...Jte5?! 25 64 J,d4+ 26 flxd4 ^ixd4 27 Ag5 Wgl 28 f5 or 27...^ie2+ 28 *hl ^xf4 29 Jtxf4 Bf8 30 h3! d4 (30...%7 31 Bf3) 31 jtc2! and wins; b) 24...£ie5 25 f4 £>xg6 26 Wxg6+ kgl 27 Bfel Bd6 28 ikg7+ Wxg7 29 Axg7, and White’s three connected passed pawns should decide the outcome in his favour. The question suggests itself: does this mean that Black’s entire strategy was incorrect? Objectively, yes. However, it must be borne in mind that this game was played at the dawn of the Griinfeld Defence’s development, and a complicated, little-studied position had arisen. The consequences of the piece sacrifice no doubt seemed far from obvious to Filip (this was still in the pre-Tal era!) and, with the aim of clarifying the situation as soon as possible, he chose a quieter continuation, which seemed like the optimal solution to the problem. 7 7 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 20.. Jtxe5!i You don't have to be a Tal, in order after 20.. .d4? 21 e6 We7 22 exf7+ IBxf7 to calculate the combinative blow 23 jtc4! ®xc4 24 <5ixg6 and wins. But you have to be a Korchnoi, in order to find 20...Axe5!! This looks like a blunder, but in fact it is a quite paradoxical queen sacrifice. 21 ±xc6 (21 £lxd5 WxdS 22 ±.xc6 ±xh2+! or 22 fixd5 2xd5 23 jtxc6 Jlxh2+! is unfa¬ vourable for White) 21...±xf4 22 #f6 Mate is threatened, and the queen is hang¬ ing — many players with Black, on seeing this position from afar, would simply have stopped their calculations. But Korchnoi sub¬ tly appreciated that the sacrifice of his queen for two bishops and two pawns gives good counter-chances. 22.. JLxh6 23 ±xd7 flxd7 ‘Black's compensation for the queen is rather slight, but the character of the position has changed. Instead of an attack on the king. White is faced with solving difficult problems.’ (Korchnoi). Indeed, it is hard for his rooks to invade the enemy position (the bishops pre¬ vent this), and most important — they are re¬ stricted by the passed d-pawn. Moreover, in blockading this pawn, a rook will come under attack by one of the bishops. 24 fifel ±f8! Preventing He7: any exchange is to White’s advantage, since the power of the queen is sharply increased. A similar situation occurred in a game of mine with Karpov (3rd match- game, New York 1990), where I sacrificed my queen for two minor pieces and a pawn: my opponent also had to exchange pieces, even at the cost of material... 25 h4?! Routinely played, but with the dark-squared bishop on the board the attack with h2-h4-h5 has no point 25 fld3 with the threat of Hde3- e8 was correct, when Black, to prevent the exchange of rooks, would have to play 25.. .JLb41? (Korchnoi). It is clear that White’s chances are better; the question is how much. 25.. .2.d8 26 h5?! Had Filip looked a litde into the future, he would have realised that the pawn should be immediately blockaded by 26 Bd4I, since after 26.. .Jig! 27 Hft4 the immediate exchange 27.. Jtxd4 28 Wxd4 is dangerous for Black in view of the weakening of his king’s defences. However, the cool-headed 27...h5 would have maintained an unclear position. To exploit the power of his queen, White would have had to play g2-g4, and this is a rather committing decision. But through inertia Filip made the ‘attack¬ ing’ move 26 h5?! A typical situation when a player, after gaining an advantage, did not find the correct plan and allowed his opponent to change the direction of the play with the help of an unexpected sacrifice. Such turning points are normally unsettling, and in such a state it is not easy to find the strongest moves. This is the main danger when facing players such as Korchnoi, who sense such psycho¬ logical nuances very keenly and do not miss an opportunity to launch a counterattack. 26.. .d4 (after this move White now has to play accurately to keep the balance) 27 hxg6 hxg6 28 Hd3 , a6 It is not just that Black has succeeded in advancing his passed pawn — now, in the event of the exchange of rook for bishop, he will retain his dark-squared bishop, which apart from anything else is performing the important role of defending his king. 18 Viktor the Terrible 29 Sedl? With time-trouble approaching, Filip com¬ pletely loses the thread of the game and gives up the exchange. According to Korchnoi, White could have drawn without difficulty by 29 Hh3 Jtg7 30 Wc6 (or 30 Wh4 d3 — you can’t frighten Korchnoi with a single check on h7!) 30...d3 31 2e8+ Hxe8 32 Wxd7 Ab5! 33 WxbS 2el+ 34 Ah2 d2 35 Sd3 dl# 36 Sxdl Hxdl 37 Wa6 2d5 38 Wxa7 Sa5 and ...Hxa2. 29.. .1.xd3 30 Sxd3 ‘A position has been reached with a mini¬ mal advantage for Black. The end of the game took place in a severe time scramble, and I managed to outwit my opponent.’ (Korchnoi) 30.. .5c8 Black has excellent material compensation for the queen — rook, bishop, a couple of pawns and a well-fortified king. His plan includes creating another passed pawn on the queenside. Even so. this may not be sufficient for a win. It is not our objective to ascertain the exact evaluation of this endgame, but it is interesting to observe the en¬ ergy and resourcefulness with which Korchnoi conducts the technical stage of the game. 31 Wf3 Perhaps the best practical chance of saving the game was to go into a rook ending a pawn down — 31 flxd4 Jtg7 32 Wxg7+ <4>xg7 33 fixd7 (Korchnoi), although after 33...ficl+ 34 <&)h2 a5 it is hard for White to exchange his a- pawn for the b-pawn and Black most probably has a technically won position. 31...jLg7 32 #e4 Scd8 33 f4 fld5 34 g4 Af6 35 *g2 ^f8 36 *f3 b5 37 Wei 4?g8 38 Wb4 S8d7 39 «b3?! a5 40 a3 Sc5 41 Wbl ldc7 42 4>e2 a4 43 *h1 27c6 44 ®b1 2c8 45 t^hl 2c2+ 46 Sd2 After 46 4?f3 there is a choice between the sharp 46...b4 47 axb4 a3, and if 48 2xa3, then 48.. .fi2c3+ 49 fixc3 dxc3 (Korchnoi), and the quiet 46...flcl. 46.. .fie8+ 47 4?d1 flc3 48 «d5 ‘48 g5 was more tenacious. In this case the attempt by Black to win at once by 48...d3? would not have worked: 49 gxf6 Sxa3 50 Sa2 Bxa2 51 Wh.6 and it is White who wins.’ (Korchnoi). But after 48...flxa3 Black would have retained a decisive advantage. 48.. .5.a3 49 #xb5 Hanging over White, like a sword of Da¬ mocles, is the threat of ...d4-d3: 49 g5 d3! or 19 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 49 Wc6 2al+ 50 4>c2 d3+! etc. 49...Sal + 50 *c2 50...1c8+ According to Korchnoi, 50...fie3 was sim¬ pler, with the threat of 51...d3+ 52 Bxd3 Se2+, for example: 51 ®d5 flc3+ 52 <$£b2 d3, or 51 W38+ 4?g7 52 g5 d3+ 53 2xd3 Se2+ 54 Hd2 Ba2+ 55 icl Jlb2+! 56 fixb2 fiaxb2, and further resistance is pointless. 51 'idS Sel (51...a3! was winning) 52 Uc2?!

This decided the outcome of the tournament: 1. Korchnoi — 13 out of 17; 2. Nezhmetdinov — 12V2; 3-4. Filip and Khol¬ mov— 11, etc. At that time the qualifying rules were se¬ vere: although he was a silver medal winner in the national championship and a newly- fledged international master, to reach the next, 22nd USSR Championship (a world champi¬ onship Zonal!) he again had to overcome the semi-final barrier. In the first round of the final (Moscow 1955), Korchnoi encountered problems with Black against Simagin in his favourite Griinfeld Defence, conducted a dif¬ ficult defence, and then analysed the ad¬ journed position for two days, but on the re¬ sumption he was unable to save it. For a long time this painful defeat left Viktor in a state of psychological shock. The outcome was 19th place, last but one... However, soon he showed that this was an accidental failure. First he was successful in the next USSR Championship semi-final — in these tournaments Korchnoi’s play was un¬ commonly stable: eight years in a row he took one of the qualifying places (twice finishing first). Then for the first time he became Len¬ ingrad Champion (17 out of 19), shared vic¬ tory with Olafsson in the traditional Hastings tournament (1955/56) and performed wor¬ thily in the 23rd USSR Championship: 1-3. Averbakh, Spassky and Taimanov — IIV2 out of 17; 4. Korchnoi — 11; 5-7. Kholmov, Po- lugayevsky and Tal — IOV2, etc. After finally gaining the grandmaster title, Viktor took something of a respite: in the next three championships of the country he occu¬ pied modest places in the middle of the tour¬ nament table. However, with striking wins in individual games he as though warned the chess world: the day is not far off when the genie will escape from the bottle! In previous volumes I have already talked 20 Viktor the Terrible about the Zonal USSR Championship of 1958, which brought a brilliant triumph for Tal and a bitter disappointment for Spassky. But even on the threshold of his finest hour the ‘Riga magician’ was unable to solve the Korchnoi problem, losing to him in the mid¬ dle of the tournament Incidentally, after this setback Tal finished with 8 out of 9(1). It is well known that, for Tal, Korchnoi was the most difficult and awkward opponent — the only player in the world against whom, after becoming champion and even ex¬ champion of the world, he had not won a sin¬ gle game, while losing five with five draws! For many years afterwards too, the character of their chess relations did not change. Before their Candidates semi-final match in 1968 the score in their decisive games was 9-1 in Korchnoi’s favour, and after the match it be¬ came 11-2. And only towards the end of their rivalry, in the mid-1980s, did Tal manage to improve slightly on this catastrophic balance. It was probably Korchnoi’s ‘crooked’ style that did not allow Tal to dictate matters in games with him, as when playing other oppo¬ nents. Tal liked to sacrifice and seize the initia¬ tive, but this did not bother Korchnoi: he happily took ‘everything that was going’, de¬ fended tenaciously, and at the first opportu¬ nity launched a counterattack. And the main thing — he did not lose his head in the face of Tal’s fierce onslaught! The game between them from that Championship, despite the mutual mistakes and inaccuracies, is very typi¬ cal of the rivalry between Tal and Korchnoi in the 1950s-1960s. It was a fierce clash of two diametrically opposed chess conceptions — attacking and defensive. Game 3 M.Tal-V.Korchnoi 25th USSR Championship, Riga 1958, 9th round French Defence Cl 8 1 e4 e6 Korchnoi’s favourite reply to 1 e4, to which he retains a devotion even today. Many of his brilliant tournament and match victories are associated with the French Defence. 2 d4 d5 3 £ic3 (3 $362 - Game Nos.13, 52 and 53) 3..Jtb4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 Axc3+ 6 bxc3 k\el Botvinnik’s favourite plan. Korchnoi, who picked up and developed his ideas, very suc¬ cessfully handled this complicated and unbal¬ anced position, where there is a basic conflict: White has the two bishops and a powerful centre, but on the other hand he has chronic weaknesses on the queenside, which are obvi¬ ous targets for Black’s counterplay. At that time such double-edged schemes were an ideal weapon for a player with a counterattacking style. 7 #g4 (7 a4 - Game Nos. 12, 22 and 23) 7.. .^f5 Later Korchnoi played only 7...Wc7 or 7.. .cxd4 (Game Nos. 14 and 27), as well as 7.. .0.0! By his own admission, he employed the knight move ‘only once in my life — with the aim of catching Tal in a prepared varia¬ tion.’ And he caught him! 8 ±63 h5 9 ®h3 It stands to reason that Tal repeats the game that he won against Petrosian (24th USSR Championship, Moscow 1957), al¬ though he had also employed 9 HT4! (against Erepova, Riga 1953). In that case he may not have liked the exchange of queens after 21 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 9.. Mh4 (the current fashion is for 9...®c7!?) 10 4}e2 Wxf4 11 4^e7 (Bisguier-Fine, New York 1948). Here White has somewhat the better endgame, but as Korchnoi wrote many years ago, ‘evidently this positional con¬ tinuation is not at all to the taste of the tem¬ peramental Tal.’ It is curious how tastes change: the later Tal preferred to go into this endgame against Pet¬ rosian (50th USSR Championship, Moscow 1983), although he was unable to realise the advantages of his position... For more details about 9 Wf4!, see the game Stein-Petrosian, brilliantly won by White {Volume 3, Game No.56). However, 9 Wh3 does not yet spoil anything. 9.. .cxd4 The critical position of the variation. 10 3?! But this is too devil-may-care! White's chances are mainly associated with disclosing the weakness of the dark squares in the oppo¬ nent's position, for example: 10 dxc3 11 Jtxf5 exf5 12 ®g3, or immediately 10 Jtxf5 exf5 11 cxd4 (if 11 H^g3 Euwe suggested 11... Jle6 12 ®xg7?! <4>d7 and ...2g8; ll...g6 12 cxd4 &4c6 13 4£)f3(e2) h4! and 14...h3 is also not so clear) ll...^c6 12 Wa5+ 13 Jtd2 ®b5 14 1tfe3, and Black still has to solve the problem of evacuating his king. Instead of this White initiates play on both flanks, in particular planning the aggressive g2- g4. But in the process his king is deprived of a secure shelter and Black acquires excellent counter-chances. The young Tal believed im¬ plicitly in his lucky star, which Korchnoi ex¬ ploited, demonstrating a subtle understanding of his opponent’s psychology. After all, in the majority of positions you must make objec¬ tively the best moves, and not those that cor¬ respond to your style or frame of mind. Espe¬ cially if the latter are obviously expected by your opponent! 10.. .#c7! An important improvement — a gain of tempo. In the previous year’s USSR Championship Tal had breached the defences of‘iron Tigran’ after 10...^c6?! 11 g4 ^fe7 12 gxh5! Wcl (12...Wa5!?) 13 ±f4 ^g6 14 %4 4^xf4 15 Wxf4 dxc3 16 Wg5! etc. Alternatively 10.. .dxc3 11 g4 ^e7 12 gxh5 is no better for Black, while if 10...Hfa5 there would probably have followed 11 Sbl (11 0-0!?) ll...Hfxc3+ (ll...dxc3 12 g4) 12 jtd2 ttxa3 13 g4 (the positional 13 0-0 with the idea 14 JtxfS exf5 15 Wg3 is again good) 13...^e7 14 gxh5 (14 4^xd4 a6 is less clear) followed by flgl — such positions with active rooks and an enduring initiative very much appealed to Tal. From c7 the queen both attacks the enemy pawns (c3 and in particular e5) and also pro- phylactically defends the b7-pawn in anticipa¬ tion of ...4^bc6, ...jtd7 and ...0-0-0. However, in fact neither side manages to castle — an¬ other indication of the high intensity of the struggle that prevailed in this game. 22 Viktor the Terrible 11 Hbl (11 0-0 did not fit in with the planned g2-g4) 11...dxc3 There was no great point in playing 11.. .Hrxc3+ 12 Jld2 and g2-g4 (as after 10.. .Wa5). However, ll...^c61? was also ac¬ ceptable: 12 g4 <S3fe7 13 cxd4 ?3xd4 14 ^hxd4 1A3+ 15 ±62 ffxd4 16 f4 (Konstantinopol- sky-Ivashin, correspondence 1948) 16...jtd7 with an unclear game. 12 g4 £>e7 13 gxh5 This may become a dangerous passed pawn if White, by creating pressure on the g-file, is able to capture on g7 or force ...g7-g6. But Black requires only two more moves to castle queenside, his pieces are compactly placed, and he has a material advantage and counter¬ play against the e5-pawn. 13.. .^bc6 14±f4 Apparently the best move. This position is reached in his book by Keres, who judges it to be in White’s favour, since, in his opinion, the g7-pawn is bound to be lost The present game shows that the situation is highly dou¬ ble-edged,’ writes Korchnoi, who refutes 14 ®g3?l HxhS 15 Wxgl £3xe5 16 £ig5 ^3xd3+ 17 cxd3 £3g6 18 Wg8+ <53f8 19 f4 f6, winning, and considers that 14 ^Pdl (with the idea of 14.. .£ixe5 15 ®g3) comes into consideration, although, in my view, after the simple 14.. .Jtd7 and ...0-0-0 White has no real com¬ pensation for the disintegration of his centre and the insecure position of his king. 14...£ig6! This resource, prepared at home, was over¬ looked by Keres in his analysis: Black never¬ theless gets to the e5-pawn which is cramping his game. After 14...g6?! 15 h6 16 0-0 <§3ce7 17 h7 53g7 18 <S^g5 White would have retained the initiative. 15 Jtg3 (the bishop exchange 15 Jtxg6 fxg6 would have signified the failure of White’s plan) 15...£igxe5 Now, in order to justify his audacious play in the opening, Tal has to display miracles of resourcefulness. 16^xe5 White incorrectly restricts his range of pos¬ sibilities. It was fundamentally more correct to move the king without exchanging knights — 16 <A)fl.’ (Korchnoi). However, after 16...f6 White faces difficult problems: 17 jtb5 ±d7 18 ±xc6 (Korchnoi) 18...1kc6! 19 ±xcS 0-0-0!, and 20 JLg3(d4) is not possible on ac¬ count of 20...e5 with a decisive counterattack. Therefore Tal’s move should hardly be con¬ demned. 16.. .£ixe5 17 *f1 (17 sfedl? £>xd3!) 17.. .Ad7 (17...f6?! 18lgl!) 18 ®h4? ‘The activation of the queen is a significant mistake, which could have placed White in a difficult position. He should have played 18 Hel, and after 18...f6 19 jtg6+ wherever the king moves White retains the initiative.’ (Korchnoi). For example: 19...4H8 20 c4)g2 with the threat of 21 2xe5! fxe5 22 2el and 23 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Jtxe5xg7, opening the way for the h-pawn. 18.. .f6? The immediate breakthrough in the centre — 18...d4 is also ineffective in view of 19 Sgl! (but not 19 Wxd4 Wc6 20 ±e4 1tfc4+ 21 Wxc4 22 Jtxb7 Hd8) 19...'ttc5 20 jtxe5 ttxe5 21 S.g5 Wf6 22 Hxb7 jtc6 23 Hc7 with substantial compensation for the pawn, or 19.. .£>f3 20 ±xc7 £kh4 21 flxg7 ±c6 22 Jtf4! (again relying on the passed h-pawn) 22.. .6.7 (22...2d8 23 h6; 22...£tf3 23 J.c2!P and fig3) 23 J,g5+ *f8 24 ±t6 £\f3 (24...Sxh5 25 J,h7!) 25 Sg3 with a double- edged endgame. However, in Korchnoi's opinion, ‘White’s previous move could have been punished by the powerful tactical stroke 18...£tf3!, since the complications after 19 Wb4 Wc6 (19...e5!? - G.K) or 19 %4 £>d2+ 20 <4>g2(e2) e5 21 Wxg7 0-0-0 are clearly in Black’s favour.’ 19 h6! is stronger, retaining the tension on the kingside. Thus in the event of 19...g5?! 20 Wh5 (20 %4!?) 20...£id2+ 21 <4>g2 Wc6 (21..Mc5 22 Ixb7) 22 jtb5 Wc8 23 Wxg5 White’s attack fully compensates for his mate¬ rial deficit. But after 19...4ixh4! 20 hxg7 0-0-0! 21 gxh8# lxh8 22 Axc7 <4>xc7 Black has two pawns for the exchange and the better ending. 19 Jtxe5! (now Tal’s bold idea proves justi¬ fied) 19...«xe5 After 19...fxe5 20 ±g6+ 4f8 21 Wb4+ 4g8 22 Wxb7 (Korchnoi) White has a comfortable game: it is not clear how Black, can bring his h8-rook into play (if 22...Wc6, then 23 Hgl). 20 2xb7 2b8! (exchanging the menacing rook on the 7th rank; 20...g5? 21 ®b4!) 21 Hxb8+ Interposing 21 f4 came into consideration.’ (Korchnoi). Then after 21...®d6 22 Hxb8+ @xb8 23 %4 it is no longer good to play 23.. .4f8? 24 Sgl, but 23...f5! 24 %5 (24 #xg7? #xf4+ 25 4g2 #h6 and wins) 24.. . jtb5! is possible, with advantage to Black. 21 ...#xb8 22 *g4 (after 22 Hgl?! Korchnoi was intending 22...g5, but 22...

Black returns the last of the sacrificed pawns, but his king finds a comfortable shelter at g7.5 (Korchnoi) 24 hxg6! I do not think that ‘it was more correct to go into a roughly equal endgame5 — 24 h4 ®f4 25 hxg5 ttxg4 26 Sxg4 (Korchnoi), since af¬ ter 26...e5!

Generally speaking. Black must now watch carefully, to safeguard his rear against the penetration of the white queen.5 (Korchnoi). 25...Wd6 or 25...Wb7 is also worth studying. 26 Sg3 #b1 + 27 *g2 If 27 ie2 Black was planning 27.. Jk,b5 with the exchange of bishops, although after 28 Jlxb5 Wxb5+ 29 &f3 both sides have chances.

Thus, starting from the 19th move, attack and defence have balanced each other and the most logical outcome would have been a draw. But Tal, as often happened with him after a favourable turn of events, was no longer thinking just of maintaining equality, but of winning! And he overstepped the mark... 30 ±xc6 Wxc6+ 31 sfegl Wd5 32 ®f4 We5 33 h6+?? 25 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors In time-trouble Tal imagined that he saw a ‘winning combination’, which has a simple refutation. He could have drawn by 33 Wf3! #d5 34 «T4 (or 34 #xd5 exd5) 34...We5 35 Wf3 with a repetition of moves. 33.. JXxh6 34 ®xh6+ *xh6 35 g7 #xg3+ 0-1 A dramatic game! Their duel in the next national champion¬ ship had a similar outcome. Korchnoi again had Black and this time he outwitted his op¬ ponent in a Sicilian Defence, employing the Najdorf Variation. He again withstood that intense pressure, which proved unbearable for many other opponents of the young Tal. This is how Viktor Vasiliev characterised the two chess antipodes: ‘Korchnoi’s style is Tal’s style, as though turned inside out. Tal always strives to seize the initiative, whereas Korchnoi is ready to concede it without regret Tal likes to attack, Korchnoi to defend. Tal plays especially con¬ fidently with White, Korchnoi with Black. Tal himself, half-jokingly, half-seriously, calls his constant failures a protracted case of “Korchnoi-fear”, but the reason probably lies elsewhere. Apparendy, Korchnoi’s counterat¬ tacking style with its inexhaustible defensive resources and tenacious striving to upset the balance enables him to steadfasdy withstand Tal’s attacks.’ We should not forget that at that time the Riga grandmaster was accomplishing a magical surge to the chess summit and was practically irresistible. Korchnoi alone was able success¬ fully to withstand the new star, and this fact gives some impression as to the strength of his play at the end of the 1950s. After the 25th USSR Championship Mik¬ hail Yudovich tried to give a more concrete evaluation of his style: ‘Korchnoi’s play is characterised by bold experiments, distinctive positional evaluation, and an original treat¬ ment of strategic problems, especially his re¬ sourcefulness and tenacity in the defence of difficult positions. Korchnoi did not achieve any great competitive successes in the tour¬ nament, on account of a certain “slovenliness” in the technical stage of the game, and also because his originality in the handling of cer¬ tain opening variations was sometimes trans¬ formed into affectation, conflicting with the demands of the position. Korchnoi is a player of great potential, and he should strive to en¬ sure that his creative bursts do not come into conflict with the rigid practice of tournament play. There is no doubt that he should also try and get rid of his customary time-troubles.’ I don’t know whether Viktor Lvovich read these lines, but very soon, despite his ‘custom¬ ary5 time-troubles, his results sharply im¬ proved... First Gold The peak of the early period of Korchnoi’s career came in the 27th USSR Championship (Leningrad, January-February 1960), where he finally won the first of his four gold medals. Players of the older generation remember the incredible intensity of the struggle in the So¬ viet Championships and the star-studded fields, with which few international tourna¬ ments could compare. The title of USSR Champion was highly valued: for many years it was a kind of admission to the elite of world chess. Playing in his native city, Viktor was initially rather nervous and found it difficult to get into his best form: he lost to Lutikov, shared the point with Taimanov, defeated Sakharov in his patent counterattacking style (again the Najdorf Variation in the Sicilian Defence!), then Nei and Smyslov, but lost to Simagin — and after six rounds he was a point behind the leader Petrosian. The turning point came in an uncommonly dramatic and intriguing game with Leonid Shamkovich. The ‘miracle’ that occurred in it seems to be straightforward luck, but, knowT- ing the essence of Korchnoi’s play, his very approach to chess, one can find not a mystical. 26 Viktor the Terrible but a fully rational explanation of the events that occurred in the nervy atmosphere during play. This is what Tal and his second Koblents wrote about this game: ‘It is quite clear: to be a devoted “fan” of Korchnoi, in particular you need iron nerves and a heart of steel. These qualities were espe¬ cially needed by the Leningrad public, when their favourite met the Moscow master Shamkovich, After spinning the grandmaster in the opening with an interesting pawn sacri¬ fice, Shamkovich quickly seized the initiative, and soon the storm clouds were gathering over the black position. Korchnoi, as usual, was resisting desperately, but the Muscovite already had his opponent in a “full nelson”. The arbiters were ready to register the mo¬ ment when the grandmaster’s shoulders touched the mat../ Gam 4 L.Shamkovich-V.

But in such a situation it is very difficult to avoid losing your head and to switch to the calculation of sharp variations, in which, to develop a winning at¬ tack, you have to make a temporary sacrifice of material. 27 c6+? An impulsive time-trouble move — a pawn sacrifice, dictated by the desire to deprive the enemy king of the c6-square, after which the invasion of the queen at g7 looks fatal for Black (the immediate 27 Wxgl encounters the same drawing mechanism: 27..JSf3+! 28 4xf3 ®xdl+).

However, his main rivals also sharply accelerated: Petrosian was level with him (both had IV2 out of 10), and Geller and Bronstein were a point behind. The tournament began at a rather sluggish tempo/ Bronstein wrote immediately after¬ wards. ‘Not seeing any brilliant combinations, not finding grounds for excitement, the spec¬ tators were exclaiming: “It’s boring without Tal!” But suddenly it all changed. A worthy replacement for Tal was found — Korchnoi, a player of exceptional talent and distinctive style. His fighting, uncompromising play un¬ doubtedly had a positive influence on the en¬ tire tournament fight/ In the words of Tal and Koblents, ‘at the start of the second half of the tournament everyone wondered whether Korchnoi would be able to continue his winning run — after all, his opponent in the 10th round was the hith¬ erto undefeated Polugayevsky/ This game became a classic of the Grunfeld Defence, finding its way into all the opening books. It turned out to be unusually sharp, and in this complicated, non-standard struggle Korchnoi simply proved stronger and showed himself in his full glory: when specific, calcu¬ lating play began, his famous counterattack went into operation. It was under the influ¬ ence of this game that, half a century later, I took up the Grunfeld Defence, including the variation with 7../?3a6. Game 5 L.Polugayevsky-V.

Volume 2). 8Ve2 Or 8 ±f4 c5, as in my games with Topalov (Sarajevo 1999) and Piket (Wijk aan Zee 2000). 8...c5 9 d5 e6 10 0-0 exd5 11 exd5 ±f5 The standard reply, leading to a tabiya from the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s. Nowadays the unusual move 11...^3b4 is also popular, with the idea of 12 JSdl b6, exploit¬ ing the position of the knight at b4. 12 a3 Preventing the invasion of the black knight at b4. But this is a slow plan (theory was then making only its first, timid steps), and it is bet¬ ter for White simply to complete his devel¬ opment. In his world championship matches against me Karpov played 12 JLf4 or 12 fldl (as did later Piket and Anand), while Timman and Khalifman went 12 Jte3. For details — see Volume 7. Incidentally, Korchnoi evaluates the dia¬ gram position in favour of White, reckoning that ‘thanks to his strong central pawn he should have an advantage, although Po¬ lugayevsky was not able to demonstrate this, nor were Kasparov’s many opponents.’ Nev¬ ertheless, I came to realise that Black does indeed face difficult problems. Thus in my game with Piket (Amsterdam 1995) I was un¬ able to restrain the advance of the passed d- 30 Viktor the Terrible pawn. And I realised that in our era it is really too dangerous to play such complicated, stra¬ tegically risky set-ups after a lengthy interval, relying only on residual impressions from many years earlier. 12.. .He8 13 Sell (13 &£4 £>e4 14 £ib5!? is sharper - Bronstein) 13...£te4 (13...Wb6 is also good) 14 Jte3 <2id6!?

It looks illogical, but it cre¬ ates a mass of threats! In particular, 16...^xc3 17 bxc3 Be43 (Korchnoi) It is curious how the assessment of the knight leap has changed: Tal generously awarded it two exclamation marks, Korchnoi and other commentators gave it one, but in Korchnoi’s recent book My Best Games (Olms, 2001) there is altogether no mark. I go further: the move, although unexpected, is objectively dubious... 16 £ib5?! 16 Jtxa6 bxa6 17 <$3a4 ®a5 18 4ixc5 4ixc5 19 b4 Wd8! etc. is advantageous to Black. After a long think Polugayevsky sacrifices his b2-pawn, in order to create his own play, based on the strength of his d-pawn. Karpov acted in similar fashion against me in the 19th game of our 1986 match. But in the given instance 16 Ad3! was bet¬ ter, to exploit not only the strength of the d- pawn, but also the poorly defended black king.

Korchnoi condemns this move, suggesting instead 19 Wd6 or 19 Wg3 ‘with roughly equal chances.’ However, if 19 Wd6, then 19...Wa5! and ..

Black has two pieces for a rook, but White’s powerful passed pawn, to all appearances, gives him equal chances. 19.. .£>h5 20 ^xb7 Wc8 21 #d6? Seemingly natural, but in fact the losing move. 21 <§3d6 was essential, and although after 21...Hfb8 White would have lost material without sufficient compensation’ (Korchnoi), he had an interesting queen sacrifice — 22 ttxfS! gxf5 23 ^xe8 1§xe8 24 Jtxa6 Wa4 25 ile2 with saving chances. True, by playing 32 Viktor the Terrible 25.. .c4!P or 25...4}f6! Black would nevertheless retain an obvious advantage. 21.. .®b8! A brilliant reply, quite overlooked by Po- lugayevsky. Now both ...®xb7 and ...Af8 are threatened, and it becomes clear that White is bound to lose material. His attack proves to be a mirage, whereas Black’s pieces suddenly, and as if by magic, occupy the necessary squares. 22 ±b5 (22 h3 Wxb7 23 g4 ±bl or 23...±e4 and wins) 22...Sxe3! ‘Avoiding a clever trap: 22..

Then Viktor played draws with Bronstein, Petrosian and Averbakh, and defeated Gur- genidze and Spassky. With 11 out of 15, he was leading together with Petrosian, half a point ahead of Geller. But at this moment, four rounds before the finish of this exhaust¬ ing marathon, a terrible grimace of fortune awaited Korchnoi. 33 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Game 6 V.Bagirov-V. Korchnoi 27th USSR Championship, Leningrad 1960,16th round 26..Jlc3 27 Axa8?! (27 flxe3! Wxe3 28 4ixf7! Sxdl 29 ^xh6+ would have forced a draw), and here Korchnoi, who was intending to play 27...Axel 28 fixel (28 Ab7? Sxd6 29 exd6 e2! and wins) 28...fixa8 29 Wf3 e2, by mistake picked up... the bishop at a6! ‘All this happened literally in seconds/ writes Viktor Vasiliev. ‘He removed the bishop from the board and, going pale, he doze with his hand raised. Meeting BagiroVs glance, he whispered barely audibly “I resign”. Quickly, making an effort to stop his hand shaking, he signed the score-sheets, stood up and, not looking to either side, not seeing and not hearing anything, he left. If he had heard how the auditorium of the Len¬ ingrad Palace of Physical Culture began to groan, when the sense of what had happened reached the spectators... He walked home, tormenting himself with one question: how could this have happened? So feebly, so ridiculously to lose half a point, or more probably a whole point — after all, Bagirov’s position was clearly worse, and in addition he was running into time-trouble. How stupid, to pick up the wrong bishop and imme¬ diately lose everything — a rook, the game, and with it hopes of the long-awaited title of USSR Champion...’ Yes, this was a very severe blow, and after it few would have been unable to come to their senses. The position in the leading group changed: now Geller had broken half a point clear. In the next round, taking great risks and passing close to defeat, Korchnoi managed to defeat Krogius. The ridiculous blunder against Bagitov in no way troubled Korchnoi/ wrote Tal and Koblents. ‘He possesses one of the most dis¬ tinctive styles, which is not at all easy to di¬ vine. Incidentally, one of the authors of this article (it is not hard to guess which!) has not managed to find any at all appropriate key to the enigma of the Leningrad player. Possibly the game with Krogius will enable a step to be made in this direction. The opening was played very quietly... Suddenly Korchnoi sharply changed track, and the opponent’s isolated pawn became very strong. It is prob¬ able that this plan was in principle incorrect, but it contained many pitfalls, one of which Krogius did not manage to avoid.’ However, that day his rivals also won, maintaining the status quo: Geller — 12% out of 17, Korchnoi and Petrosian — 12. Then came the penultimate round, the deci¬ sive encounter with Geller. Yes, it is very inter¬ esting if the leaders meet at the finish, and es¬ pecially if they have such an attractive style of play. This game, like a magnet, drew the atten¬ tion of the entire auditorium.’ (Tal, Koblents) It was clear that only a win (with Black!) would give Korchnoi real chances of the gold. A win over an opponent who had a reputation for being very much a ‘white’ player, and who, in addition, was in excellent form: before this game Geller had scored 9 out of 10! On this occasion he would have been satisfied with a draw, and it is hard to imagine how one could consciously play for a win with Black against a top-class grandmaster, well-known for his deep opening preparation. Nevertheless, Korchnoi was able to set his opponent difficult problems — both purely chess, and psychological, which in the end proved insoluble even for Geller. 34 Viktor the Terrible Game 7 E.Geller-V. Korchnoi 27th USSR Championship, Leningrad 1960,18th round Alekhine Defence BO3 1 e4£tf6 The first surprise: White is invited to seize space and fight for an advantage, but., in very complicated and sharp play! The choice of opening more or less corresponded with my reckless mood; although the Alekhine De¬ fence is not totally correct, it is a fighting opening. It is no accident that it is occasionally employed by Fischer, Larsen and Hort’ (Korchnoi) In addition, this defence had never previ¬ ously occurred in any of Geller’s serious games. But, knowing his innate maximalism, it could be assumed that he would try to ‘pun¬ ish’ his opponent for his audacity, he would be drawn into the maelstrom of battle, and for a while would forget about his competitive ob¬ jectives — about the fact that he needed a draw7. Which is exactly what happened! 2 e5 £id5 3 d4 d6 4 c4 Later, until the end of his career, Geller al¬ most exclusively played 4 £\£3 (in particular, against Korchnoi, Stockholm Interzonal 1962). 4.. .£ib6 5 f4 (the most aggressive, but also the most double-edged variation) 5...jLf5 (5...dxe5 6 fxe5 c5?! — Volume 2, Game No.60) 6 £>c3 dxe5 7 fxe5 e6 8 £>f3 Ae7 They usually play 8...£ic6! 9 Jte3 Jtg4, 9..

Black solves his opening problems, although White retains a certain advantage in space. 11 Jtf4?! The absence of the knight from c6 induced Geller to seek new ways, but in this set-up the bishop should defend the dLpawn. 11 c5 £id5 12 £3h4 is pointless in view of 12...<53xc3 13 bxc3 Jte4. After 11 Jte3, apart from 11...£}c6 Black can also play ll...fxe5 12 ^xe5 ^8d7. The line that perhaps corresponded best with White’s tournament objective was 11 exf6 JLxf6 12 Jte3 £}c6 (Black has trans¬ posed into the variation 8...4}c6 9 Jte3 jLe7, having avoided 10 d5!?) 13 #d2 We8 (13...#e7!?) 14 Sadi 2d8 15 Wcl with a minimal plus for White (Suetin-Korchnoi, 20th USSR Championship, Moscow 1952; Feldman-Korchnoi, Leningrad 1953). Korchnoi’s conclusion was unambiguous: ‘So, I had some experience with it, in contrast to Geller, who knew of this position only by hearsay. My choice of opening had been cor¬ rect! Now it was just a matter of playing well.’ 11.. .®c6 (immediately putting pressure on the d-pawn) 12 exf6 Jtxf6 13 d5 Perhaps Geller had wanted to play 13 ^b5, but here he noticed that this was a blank shot in view of 13...Sf7 (or 13...flc8 with the same idea of ...a7-a6) 14 d5 exd5 15 c5, and now not 15...Jtxb2 16 cxb6!

Some important decision has to be taken... 14 ^e5!? "There is no doubt that initially Geller was intending to play differendy — 14 d6 cxd6 15 Axd6 for example, but he did not like 15...2f7 16 c5 <2lbc4, when Black’s threats — ...<§}xb2, ...^e3 and ...4ixd6 — seem difficult to parry.

From the practical point of view, 14...We7 may have been slighdy more forceful, since it would not have been easy for White to find a way of disentangling his clump of pieces and deciding on the weakening 15 g4! However, this does not signify that 14...Jtxe5 is a mis¬ take. An impartial analysis shows that these two continuations are roughly equivalent. 15 ikxe5 £iaxc4 16 jtxc4 £ixc4 17 ±xg7! 1 overlooked this move!’, Korchnoi admit¬ ted. "King safety is one of the most important factors in the middlegame. Now it is White who has the initiative, and Black has to fight for equality.’ In my opinion, this is an exag¬ geration: Korchnoi finds a very interesting possibility of counterplay. 36 Viktor the Terrible 17.. .^e3! (after 17...*xg7 18 Wd4+ and ®xc4 White does indeed have the initiative) 18*62!? Geller’s maximalism shows itself.

Played towards the end of a very difficult tournament, it is full of fighting spirit from start to finish.’ (Korchnoi) In the final round both Korchnoi’s rivals gained victories, but he too won ‘to order’ against Suetin — and nevertheless became na¬ tional champion: 1. Korchnoi — 14 out of 19; 2-3. Geller and Petrosian — 13Y2; 4. Bagirov — 12; 5. Polugayevsky — IV/2; 6. Averbakh — 11; 7-8. Smyslov and Taimanov — IOV2; 9-10. Krogius and Spassky - 10; 11. Simagin - 9V2; 12. Bronstein - 9, etc. 38 Viktor the Terrible A brilliant finish! And staggering aggres¬ sion: + 12—3—4. ‘My thorough self-analysis bore fruit,’ Korchnoi wrote several years later. ‘I think that in the competitive sense this was one of my greatest successes.’ As we have seen, the tournament turned out well for him in not only the competitive sense, but also the creative. He triumphed by unswervingly fol¬ lowing his distinctive manner of play. His op¬ ponents, even the most famous, were unable to withstand the tension he created. This is Korchnoi’s trademark, which has distin¬ guished his play for many decades. Here are the interesting reactions of two contestants in that championship. Bronstein: ‘Essentially only three players — Korchnoi, Petrosian and Geller — were in con¬ tention for first place. Each of them had his motto: the first — “Risk and win!”, the second — “Win without risk!”, and the third - “Cre¬ ate!”. Moreover, in his style each of this trio is a genuine champion. The play of the new USSR Champion is characterised by amazing tenacity in defence, resourcefulness in attack and virtuoso mastery in the endgame... It is to be hoped that this victory will not go to the head of the young grandmaster.’ Simagin: ‘Korchnoi’s play is highly distinc¬ tive. In contrast to some of his colleagues, he does not aim to rationalise his chess style. From the very start of a game Korchnoi nor¬ mally imposes mind-boggling complications on his opponent. This striving for complica¬ tions often leads him into rather dubious posi¬ tions, where for many hours he has to parry numerous threats. He is an exceptionally strong-willed player. And in the field of tacti¬ cal mastery, Korchnoi, in my view, is not infe¬ rior to Tal.’ Drama on Curacao In the middle of an international tournament organised by the Central Chess Club (Mos¬ cow, May-June 1960) Korchnoi won five suc¬ cessive games and yet still finished half a point behind the winners: 1-2. Kholmov and Smys¬ lov 8Vi out of 11; Korchnoi — 8, etc. But here he won another textbook game in the Griin- feld Defence, and against an old ‘offender’ Vladimir Simagin - a prominent expert on this opening.

A very interesting moment — one of those, that says much about the strength of a player. The character of the position has suddenly changed: after lengthy manoeuvring it is time for unclear tactical complications with unbal¬ anced material. A player has to operate with quite different categories, and it is not every¬ one who would be able to instantly retune and correctly evaluate the new situation. But Korchnoi found a way of continuing the fight for the initiative by a counter-sacrifice of the 41 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors exchange: ‘That day I did not want to play defensively. Indeed, would White really give up his powerful bishop, which covers all the light squares in his position, for some pitiful rook?!’ Let us see what other replies would have promised. In the event of 27...^f7 28 %3xb7 White has three pawns for the piece with a solid position, and it can be considered that he has made a favourable exchange (after 28...Jte6 Korchnoi advises 29 jtg2 ‘with an unclear game’). After 27...'4?h8? 28 ^g2 Wh7 29 Shi ±h6 30 Wf31 Black is in difficulties on account of the pin on the h-file. 27..;Adi7 is better, but here too White plays 28 <4)g2! (instead of Korchnoi’s 28 f4 g5 29 fic2 Wf6 30 Sh2+ jth6 31 sfefS Si?g7 with advantage to Black) 28...#g5 29 flhl+ ±h6 30 £k!3 or 30 Hff3 with the ideas of <S\xb7 and £id3-e5, as well as Sh4 and Hchl, retaining real compen¬ sation for the sacrificed piece. 28 e4!? White continues to play for the opening of the position, hoping to exploit the pin on the rook. c...b7-b6 was threatened, and, after the retreat of the knight, ...Jtb7 or...Jte6’ (Korch¬ noi). If 28 Jtxf7+ (28 ®E3 g5!) there could have followed 28...^xf7 (28...<ixf7 29 ®f3 Sh8 30 ®d5+ is not so clear) 29 W£3 g5! Now it is bad to play 30 ^xb7 g4 31 HSfdS Jte6 32 1§b5 (32 Wc6 Hc8, and the threat of ..^g5- f3+ forces White to give up his queen) 32.. JJb8 followed by ...^g5-f3+ and a terribly strong attack on the light squares. The cau¬ tious 30 thl (30 Wd5 Hd8) 30...»xhl+ 31 i^xhl also favours Black in view of 31...b6 32 £M3 ±b7+33 <4>gl Af3! 28...fxe4 Another non-trivial decision. 28...f4 (but not 28...b6? 29 e5) 29 e5 fkg3 30 £xg3 Wh3 31 Wf3 would have led to complicated play. But here it would not be easy for Black to develop an attack on the king, and the pair of passed pawns in the centre would have given White fair prospects. And this would have been something of an achievement for Simagin: his combination would have forced the opponent not only to solve unexpected practical prob¬ lems, but also to go in for a definite strategic risk. 29 ®xe4 Things appear to be desperate for Black (29...£ixe4 30 fixe4 and wins). 29...^e6M ‘A defence that was not anticipated by my opponent.’ (Korchnoi). A fantastic, amazingly pretty move: Black does not simply eliminate the pin — he also leaves his rook to be taken with check! 30 4bxd6 JLxdB 31 fixe8+ If8 As we see, Korchnoi not only rose to the occasion when the character of the play changed sharply, but also managed to set his opponent the most unpleasant problems. Af¬ ter all, Simagin himself was striving to seize the initiative, but instead of this he is forced to 42 parry threats (for the moment — mate in one move). 32 2e4? A blunder, leading to the loss of a piece. ‘It was essential to play 32 £3 fixe8 33 <S5xe8 ®e3+ 34 <4>g2 #xe8 35 Wei, 35 Wd3 or 35 2c7 — In each case with a roughly equal game/ (Korchnoi). Even so, Black’s two bishops would have been slighdy stronger than the rook and two pawns and they might have se¬ riously disturbed the white king. Evidendy it was this that Simagin did not like. 32.. .g5! A surprise: from h6, where it was creating threats on the h-file, suddenly the queen also attacks the knight at d6. ‘My opponent proba¬ bly missed this. If this move, this idea — of winning the knight! — had not been available to Black, with 32...jtxd4 he would have gained an initiative, compensating for his ma¬ terial deficit.’ (Korchnoi). But in my opinion, after 33 Hc2! Jtxe4 (33...Sxf2? clearly does not work) 34 5hxe4 Wg7 35 Wg4 White is a healthy pawn to the good. 33 2c7 Wxd6 34 See7 If 34 flxg7+ ,4>xg7 35 ffe5 Black was plan¬ ning 35...Jlf3!, locking in the enemy king 36 2xg5+ (36 Wd2 Wh6!; 36 Wcl g4) 36...4>f6 37 Wd2 Hh8 and wins. The desperate attack along the 7th rank also achieves nothing the bishops defend all the squares. The fate of the game is decided. 34.. .±f6 35 2ed7 Viktor the Terrible 35 flcd7! Wc6 36 Sc7 was a tougher de¬ fence, practically forcing the queen sacrifice 36.. .Jtxe7! 37 flxc6 bxc6 ‘with a clear advan¬ tage to Black’ (Korchnoi). It is probably enough for a win: the lone queen can hardly prevent the rook and two bishops from creat¬ ing decisive threats to the white king. 35.. .We6 36 2xd5 White would have lost after both 36 Wbl Jte4 37 Wei Wg4 with the threat of ...Wf3, and 36 <i>h2 Ae5 (Korchnoi) or 36...Jtxd4! 36.. .Wxd5 37 Wh5 ±g7 (easily parrying the last farewell threat by the queen) 38 #g6 #xd4 39 tfe6+ *h7 40 #h3+ 4?g6 41 ®e6+ 2f6 42 ®e2 b5 43 g4 *h6 0-1 In this game Korchnoi once again displayed his best qualities — his ability to react suitably to a changing situation and to set problems that were psychologically the most unpleasant for his opponent, plus precise calculation at the critical moments. In July 1960 the USSR Champion shared first place with Reshevsky in a major interna¬ tional tournament in Buenos Aires, ahead of 18 other competitors, including Szabo, Tai- manov, Evans, Olafsson, Unzicker, Gligoric, Benko, Uhlmann, Ivkov and the young Fischer. And in the autumn he made a suc¬ cessful debut for the Soviet team at the Olympiad in Leipzig +8 —5 on board 4. I should remind you that the top three boards were Tal, Botvinnik and Keres, and the two reserves — Smyslov and Petrosian. A fantastic line-up! That memorable year was crowned by vic¬ tory over Botvinnik in the traditional Moscow-Leningrad match. Botvinnik was actively preparing for his return match with Tal, and a duel with the new national champion was simply good training for him. ‘Well, and for me to play the “Patriarch” — as he was then called — was something out of the ordinary!’ writes Korchnoi, and with his customary mercilessness to himself he criticises his notes of nearly half a century 43 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors earlier: ‘For a young grandmaster it is pleasant to boast about his win over the ex-world champion, at the same time emphasising the consistency of his play and the logical nature of the result. But in Aesopian Soviet language “I make things difficult for myself’ it means that in home analysis I was unable to find a win in the event of the bishop manoeuvre to h3. Meanwhile, there was a win... A weakly- played game by both contestants.’ He also performed splendidly in the 28th USSR Championship, a Zonal event (Mos¬ cow, January-February 1961): 1. Petrosian — 13V2 out of 19; 2. Korchnoi — 13; 3-4. Geller and Stein — 12; 5-6. Smyslov and Spassky —11, etc. The finishing drama of the 24-year-old Spassky has been described in Volume 3 (Game Nos.33 and 37). Today Boris Vasilievich explains his failure by a kind of ‘ill fate’ or ‘di¬ vine retribution’ and thinks that, had he fin¬ ished in the first four, chess history could have turned out differently: ‘If I had also gone through to the Interzonal, the Candidates tournament on Curasao could well have been won by Keres.’ True, the outcome of the tournament on Curasao could also have been different, if Stem had played in it instead of Benko... However — one is obliged to repeat once again — history does not recognise the subjunctive mood. Soon after that championship the Tal- Botvinnik return match began. Shortly before it both contestants, via their seconds, ex¬ pressed the desire to work with Korchnoi. His reaction was eloquent: ‘I declined them both. Not because I thought that I had nothing to learn from Botvinnik or Tal, but I considered that if I myself was intending to fight for the title of world champion, I should not go and work with them. In our time many young players behave differently...’ Korchnoi’s debut in the Interzonal tour¬ nament, which took place a year later, caused his supporters considerable anxiety: a sensa¬ tional fiasco in a game with Cuellar, defeats against Portisch and Fischer... Apart from the young American, Petrosian and Geller confi¬ dently reached their goal. But, nevertheless, Korchnoi also gained entry to the Candidates tournament, scoring nine wins and gaining a draw in a highly important game from the last round. Whereas Stein, who was level with him, lost, and although he occupied a qualify¬ ing sixth place, he turned out to be the ‘super¬ fluous fourth’ in the dispute of the Soviet stars, who because of the whim of FIDE had only three vacancies. The Tattle of eight’ on the distant island of Curasao (May-June 1962) has already been partly covered in Volume 4, in the chapter TThe Russian Pact’. In fact the pact consisted in three of the Soviet grandmasters — Petro¬ sian, Keres and Geller - drawing all the games among themselves. And endeavouring to win against the weakened Tal (he played soon after a major operation) and the uncompromising Korchnoi and Fischer, to say nothing about Benko and Filip, who were inferior in class. But initially this pragmatic plan did not work: after starting with four draws, Korchnoi then suddenly surged into the lead, gaining three successive wins — over Fischer, Filip (in 101 moves, after two days’ play) and Tal! Here is the first of these: Game 9 R.Fischer-V.

Generally speaking, at that time I did not play the Pirc Defence, and its various branches were totally unfamiliar to me, but Vasyukov persuaded me to take a risk: Fischer was bound to play this way!

In the second quarter he again began with four draws, and after 11 rounds he was leading together with Geller, half a point ahead of Keres and Petrosian, and one and a half ahead of Fischer. But playing flat-out in conditions of tropi¬ cal heat had its effect: he became terribly tired. ‘He was not ready for such an important event, in particular physically/ writes Viktor Vasiliev. ‘Already at the end of the first quar¬ ter, when his rivals were timorously observing his successes, Korchnoi realised perfectly well that he was incapable of fighting for first place. His play was laboured, and after every game he felt tired and jaded/ 46 Viktor the Terrible Knowing this, one is no longer surprised by the tragic blunder that occurred in Korchnoi’s game from the second quarter with Fischer. Game 10 V.Korchnoi-R.Fischer Candidates Tournament, Curasao 1962, 12th round 31 Jlc6? A mental black-out! White should have in¬ cluded 31 Wb2+!, retaining his extra pawn and every chance of winning: 31...^e5 32 ^c4, or 31.. .<4)g8 32 Jtc6 ^xc6 (otherwise b4-b5) 33 Scl ^fe5 34 dxc6 etc. 31.. .£ixc6 32 Bel?? #a7!, and Black won a piece, and with it the game. Yes, it was ter¬ rible to lose in this way to the self-confident American/ wrote the Soviet press. True, after this drama he still achieved, and in good style, his ‘regular win’ against Filip. But then he lost to Tal (the only time for many years!) and finished the second quarter only fourth, a point behind Geller and Petro¬ sian and half a point behind Keres. Yuri Averbakh, one of the Soviet grand¬ masters’ trainers, recalls: ‘After the first half of the tournament our group expanded: the wives of the contestants flew in, which brought a certain diversity to their measured life. A short break was arranged, which all the contestants spent on St Martin, an even smaller island than Curasao. There they swam and sunbathed, and five days later they again sat down to play. The start of the second half was marked by a wonderful spurt by Keres — 3 out of 3! But he was unable to break away: Petrosian and Geller were still just half a point behind him.’ It would appear that the week on the beach was the last straw for Korchnoi: at the start of the third quarter he lost in turn to Geller, Pet¬ rosian and Keres... That which happened with him on Curasao was something of a record. And not only in his individual chess career: chess history, which tells a number of tragic stories, can hardly remember an instance when, in a tournament of such scale, one of the leaders suffered four successive defeats!’ (V.Vasiliev) Korchnoi conclusively dropped out of the fight for first place and in the end he finished 4 points behind Petrosian, 3V2 behind Keres and Geller, and half a point behind Fischer. A slight consolation was provided by his win over the American in the third quarter, enabling him to win their mini-match (2V2-IV2). A characteristic touch: on all of the moves in his 27 games, the tournament winner, the pragmatic Petrosian, spent a total of 48 hours 40 minutes, whereas the implacable fighter Korchnoi spent 72 hours 10 minutes, i.e. one and a half times more! After such a failure, many could have lost heart, but not Korchnoi. On returning home, he set about trying to eliminate his chess defi¬ ciencies with redoubled energy. ‘In Curasao I lacked the discipline and technique to convert an advantage at high level (although I did pos¬ sess some technique!)’ Viktor Lvovich wrote five years later. ‘But where there was great resis¬ tance, haste appeared — perhaps my nerves failed me (yes, technique is all nerves, as Alekhine once commented — G.K). Towards the end of a game I would become tired, and as a result — blunders. I again had to sit down with my books, and study the games of Rubinstein and other experts on the endgame. Six months later, at the championship of the country in Erevan, I felt much more confident.’ 47 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Indeed, in the 30th USSR Championship (Erevan, November-December 1962) he fought only for first place, and with success: 1. Korchnoi — 14 out of 19 (after starting with 11 out of 13!); 2-3. Taimanov and Tal — 1314; 4. Kholmov — 13; 5. Spassky — 1214; 6. Stein — 1114, etc. Soon this triumph was supple¬ mented by a brilliant victory in the Capablanca Memorial tournament (Havana 1963): 1. Korchnoi — 1614 out of 21; 2-4. Geller, Pach- man and Tal — 16, etc. According to the press, the experts observed some obvious changes in his play: Korchnoi’s style had become more flexible, more universal than before. Earlier he had stated: 1 don’t like to be the first to attack, just as I don’t like to sacrifice my pieces and pawns.’ But now he increas¬ ingly often made moves, about which he would later write: £On this occasion, betraying my rules, I fought for the initiative, I sacrificed a pawn.’ In addition, he learned how to skil¬ fully exploit even a slight positional advantage. But at the same time Korchnoi realised per¬ fectly well that he had not achieved that tech¬ nical mastery for which he had aimed. Towards the end of the same year a tempo¬ rary decline occurred in his play, which was practically unavoidable, given the fierce rivalry that reigned in Soviet chess. In the 31st USSR Championship (1963) which, I should remind you, was a qualifying event not for the Inter¬ zonal, but to a double-round Zonal tourna¬ ment, Korchnoi finished 10th and was allowed into the next stage only as an "outstanding grandmaster’. But also in the Zonal "tourna¬ ment of seven’ he finished in only a share of 5th-6th places, after losing at the finish to Stein (Volume 3, Game No. 63) and Spassky. And again he did not lose heart! I was in¬ terested to leam that, like myself many years later, one of the books that Korchnoi con¬ stantly had to hand was a collection of 300 games of Alekhine, and he often turned to that chess genius for advice. Like Alekhine, he could well have said: "By means of chess I formed my character.’ Or: "Chess teaches you first and foremost to be objective. In chess you can become a great master, only by rec¬ ognising your mistakes and deficiencies.’ To another important thought of Alekhine — "To become a grandmaster, apart from great talent, you must also have a secure material future and great capacity for work’ — Korchnoi added the words: ‘A whole-hearted love for chess is also needed. The time of natural geniuses (Capablanca), who devoted little attention to preparation, has passed. Now success requires a great deal of work.’ And he, already twice USSR Champion, continued working on chess like no one else (except, perhaps, Fischer). He was 33 years old — at the very height of his powers... Later he bitterly lamented that he had lost a great deal of time in his youth, that he had not been taught to play correctly, to fight fiercely for the initiative: "I realised that I had to re-leam, that my play was littered with deficiencies, and that I was frequently unfamiliar with the ru¬ diments of grandmaster chess. And for a good ten years I endeavoured to master these rudi¬ ments. In the end when, fully armed with my knowledge and understanding of chess, at the age of forty plus I was ready to battle with anyone for the title of world champion, I had already exhausted much of my God-given energy. Therefore I did not in fact manage to become world champion...’ Opening for all Times Korchnoi’s next peak was his convincing vic¬ tory in the 32nd USSR Championship (Kiev 1964/65). Two years later he was to write: "Versatility helped. I think it was at that time that I achieved my best understanding of posi¬ tions.’ After his start — 10 out of 11! — the fate of the gold medal was already practically de¬ cided. Among those defeated were Shamkovich, Lein, Averbakh, Kholmov, Bronstein, Tal... A key game in the battle for first place was the one with Tal. It was adjourned in an end¬ game with rook and knight against rook and 48 Viktor the Terrible bishop, in which Korchnoi stood better. The master A.Petersons, a participant in the tour¬ nament, recalls: 'Since, on account of illness, Tal had many other “arrears”, for a long time the game was not resumed and was at the cen¬ tre of the attention of both the players and the numerous fans. Initially the opinion was that White should win. But here Black’s interests began to be defended by none other than Ti¬ gran Petrosian, who suggested that the most probable outcome was a draw. The Riga play¬ ers who were in Kiev — Tal, Koblents, Klovans and Petersons — spent many hours analysing the adjourned position and also came to the conclusion that the game should end in a draw.’ On the resumption Korchnoi won the ex¬ change by force, but Tal resisted desperately, pinning his hopes on the extremely limited material remaining. The crux came on the 68th move. Game 11 V.Korchnoi-M.Tal 32nd USSR Championship, Kiev 1964/65, 9th round 68.. .1Lh3? Allowing the white king to escape. After 68.. .4d3 Black would have gained a draw, for example: 69 He8 4d4 70 4el 4d3 71 ]Se7 Af3 (Petersons). 69 4e2!

Also important was the game with the Moscow grandmaster Vasyukov, a player with a sharp attacking style, who played only 1 e4. It need hardly be said that in reply Korchnoi chose his favourite French Defence. After a mistake on the 12th move he ended up in a difficult position, but according to the evi¬ dence of the press, 'as usual, he maintained enviable composure, unexpectedly seized the initiative, and the situation instantly changed in his favour.’ Game 12 E.

Although the opening did not always turn out in his fa¬ vour, he masterfully maintained the tension in the complicated 'French’ middlegame. 7...£>bc6 8^f3±d7 Later, following the example set by 49 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Korchnoi, 8...'fira5! became almost automatic, forcing 9 Wd2 (Game No.22) or 9 jtd2 {Game No.23). 9 Ae2 (Fischer preferred 9 Jtd3 — Volume 4, GameNo.95) 9...f6?!

Now White’s dark-squared bishop becomes terribly strong and Korchnoi’s position be¬ comes critical. Subsequently Black has achieved reasonable results by playing 12.. .0-0-0 or 12...e5. 13 Aa3 Vab 14 0-0 It is obvious that sooner or later c3-c4 will follow and Black will face a gruelling struggle for a draw: his pawn structure is broken, and in addition White has two formidable bishops. But it is interesting to follow how Korchnoi, deeply and creatively delving into the secrets of the position, solves his difficult problems and gradually, albeit not without the ‘help’ of his opponent, creates dangerous counterplay. 14.. .0-0 50 Viktor the Terrible Black has to restrict himself to kingside cas¬ tling: if 14...0-0-0 White has the unpleasant 15 ^M4!

A delay. 15 c4 ®xd2 16 £fxd2 also achieves little, but after 15 Sfbl! ‘Black is in consider¬ able difficulties’ (Petersons), for example: 15.. .Wc7 16 £\d4l, or 15...Jx8 16 Sb5 Wcl 17 c4. 15.. .5f7 16 c4 ‘I would have rather gone into a lion’s cage than exchanged queens with White in this po¬ sition,’ Tal joked in later analysis, suggesting 16 Wcl ‘if there is nothing better’. Indeed, after 16...Wxc3 17 Sd3 Wa5 18 £lh4 or 17 Jtb2 tta5 18 c4 White has good compensa- tion for the pawn, and therefore 16...e5 17 c4 Jte6 is better, with a complicated game. 16.. .11b(d2 (16...Sc8 was more cunning, but then White could have kept the queens on by 17 c3) 17 Hxd2 flc8 (17...£>a5i?) 18 a5 ®g6 19 a6! b6 20 Sadi? A seemingly natural move, but the black knight should not have been allowed to go to f4. However, 20 g3 (Petersons) is repulsed by 20.. .dxc4 21 JSadl (21 Jtxc4 £ke5 with equal¬ ity) 21...4^b8! etc. And only the timely 20 cxd5! exd5 21 g3 (but not 21 Hxd5P! <S3f4 22 Sd2 <S3xe2+ 23 flxe2 Jtg4!, or 21 c4?l £3a5!), as well as 21 JLd6(b2) or the subtle 21 fiel, would have condemned Black to a difficult defence: his d5-pawn is very weak, and any attack on the a7-pawn, ‘nailed’ to the board by the a6-pawn, may prove fatal for him. 20...®f4 21 Afl 21 cxd5 is no longer so clear: 21...exd5 22 JLd6 (22 AflP! JLg4!, and the rook at dl is badly placed) 22...4fxe2+ 23 fixe2 fid8 and .. JLc8!, extracting the ‘nail’ at a6. Nevertheless, it appears that White still has the initiative (he is threatening g2-g3 and cxd5). At any event, Korchnoi thought for nearly 50 minutes here. And, as the fans said at the time, he ‘did a Korchnoi’: 21.„e51? A non-standard positional pawn sacrifice, all the more unexpected for the reason that 21...^5a5 was perfectly acceptable: after 22 g3 (22 cxd5 5fxd5 is equal) 22,..^ixc4! 23 JLxc4 fixc4 24 gxf4 flxf4 Black has good compensa¬ tion for the piece (he is threatening also to pick up the a6-pawn), while if 22 jtd6 there can follow 22...^3xc4 (22...e5!P) 23 Jtxf4 £kd2 24 Ixd2 e5 25 A,h6(g3) Ae6, when the rook and pawn are no weaker than the bishop and knight. However, Korchnoi is striving not to equalise, but to seize the initiative! 22 cxd5 ®a5 The picture has changed sharply. Instead of doubled c-pawns. White now has an extra 51 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors passed pawn at d5 — and nevertheless the po¬ sition is completely unclear. This pawn has blocked the frontal action of the rooks, saving Black from pressure on the d-file. He is threatening ...^c4 (a favourite post for Korchnoi’s knights — especially in the Griin- feld Defence), and after the exchange of the bishop for this knight, the a6-pawn will he attacked by the rook from a4 or by the bishop from b5(c8) — and it will become a weakness. In addition, threats along the g-file may arise. 23 g3 (a normal move: in any case Black has fair compensation for the pawn - this is even ‘felt’ by the machine) 23...£\h3 + 23...±g4!? was also possible. The complex combination of different factors — both strate¬ gic, and tactical — makes White’s position rather dangerous. From the practical view¬ point, at any event, on the threshold of a sharp time scramble. 24 *g2 25 ±b4?! A difficult choice — an attempt to fight for the initiative! Wasyukov decided to sacrifice the exchange, so as not to weaken the light squares.’ (Petersons). But perhaps he should have been patient and played 25 JLxc4 Sxc4 26 Jtb2 Jtg4 27 Sell? However, the weak¬ nesses in White’s position would have prom¬ ised Black a fully equal game. 25...e4!? (25...^xd2! 26 Sxd2 Sg7 or 26...h6, was better, permitting ...^g5, with some advan¬ tage to Black, but Korchnoi was tempted by another, very interesting idea) 26 4id4 26.. .£)xf2!

Se5 32 d6 - 32 c4 b5! - 32...Sd5 33 Jh4) 29 Sxe4 It has to be admitted that the exchange of the f2-pawn for the e-pawn has probably proved more beneficial to White.

It was also possible to support the bishop at b4 immediately by 32 c3 (Petersons), for ex¬ ample: 32...±,f7 (32...jtg6 33 Se3 or 32...Sd7 33 d6 Jtf7 34 Sf4 is no better for Black) 33 ^e6 Jtxe6 34 dxe6 Se8 35 e7 Sgxe7 36 Jtxe7 Sxe7, and the weakness of the a7-pawn demands a certain accuracy of Black on the way to a draw. 52 Viktor the Terrible 32..

It was essential to play 33 fif4 ^xc4 34 Sl?f2, and although after 34...£ie5 35 fixf6 Sf7 36 Bxf7 <S?xf7 37 4^3 White is a litde worse, he can hope for a draw. 33.. .^.d3 (now Black wins material, and with it the game) 34 Bd7 A solid move in time-trouble.

White resigned (0-1). As a result Viktor Lvovich brilliantly won his third gold medal: 1. Korchnoi — 15 out of 19 (+11=8); 2. Bronstein - 13; 3. Tal - 12J/2; 4. Stein — 12, etc. And if his unconditional victory in the semi-final, the Leningrad Championship, is added to this, it gives an impressive unbeaten series — 30 out of 36! £Korchnoi’s splendid achievement in the semi-final was evidently not considered by some to be anything outstanding, but all chess fans unanimously acknowledged that in the final the Leningrad grandmaster was truly wonderful. He finished two points ahead of his nearest rival — the only player to achieve such a margin in USSR Championships was Botvinnik 20 years ago,’ A.Petersons enthusi¬ astically wrote in the Riga magazine Shakhmaty. And in the magazine Shakhmaty v X5TR he was echoed by B.Baranov and V.Mikenas: 'Korchnoi has caught up with Keres as re¬ gards the number of USSR Championship gold medals. Only Botvinnik has more... Korchnoi has to his credit both spectacular and combinations and fine attacks, as well as consistently conducted positional games and subtle endgames. Whereas Petrosian manoeu¬ vres for a long time, awaiting the moment for decisive action, while Tal pursues the same aim using tactical means, Korchnoi skilfully Combines both these methods in his play. cHe often gives up his own active plans and allows the opponent to carry out his ideas, if he sees flaws in them, in order to land a timely counterblow. Perhaps it is this detail that has enabled Korchnoi to discern the incorrectness of many of Tal’s attacks and to gain an over¬ whelming advantage in their individual meetings. 'Korchnoi plays the opening unpreten¬ tiously, aiming for a complicated position that is to his taste. And he happily accepts sacri¬ fices, although sometimes his decisions appear outwardly dubious. But it should be bom in mind that the Leningrad player goes in for such positions only when his fine intuition, together with his rapid and deep calculation, suggest to him that the opponent’s ideas can be refuted. In short, Korchnoi is a subtle psy¬ chologist, who is able to recognise his oppo¬ nent’s strong and weak points and direct the play along lines that suit him.’ It was after this national championship that Soviet chess officials first drew attention to the vacuum of star players that arose in the 1960s. We must dwell especially on the fact that among the participants there were no young players,’ wrote the chess press. 'It is a cheerless paradox that the “youngest” player in the tournament was the 28-year-old former world champion Tal. What is the reason for this alarming fact? Apparently, that we work badly with our chess youth, that we demand little from them, and that we do insufficient to instil fighting qualities in our young players.’ The real reason for the lack of new super- stars, the enormous 'black hole’ from Tal and Spassky to Karpov, came to light later: at least two generations were lost to chess on account of the Second World War... 53 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors It seems to me that in the USSR they worked badly* not so much with the youth, as with certain well-known grandmasters, peri¬ odically not sending them to foreign tourna¬ ments. Korchnoi was no exception — even with all his titles! Thus in 1963 he and Keres were invited to the Piatigorsky Cup in Los Angeles, but world champion Petrosian also wanted to go there. Then the organisers sent three tickets... ‘And even so I was not sent,’ remembers Korchnoi. Tetrosian’s wife went to the USA on my ticket.’ In the spring of 1965 the three-times na¬ tional champion was invited to a strong tour¬ nament in Zagreb in Yugoslavia, but instead of this the Sports Committee suggested that he should travel to a small tournament in Hungary. Of course, Korchnoi refused... True, in August he nevertheless visited Hungary and achieved an absolute record result in the Asz- talos Memorial tournament — \AVi out of 15! He also scored a significant victory at an in¬ ternational tournament in the autumn in Ere¬ van: 1. Korchnoi — 9Y2 out of 13; 2-3. Petro¬ sian and Stein — 8V2, etc. At the conclusion of the European Team Championship (Hamburg, June 1965) he was unexpectedly invited to remain in the West. He declined, replying that ‘chess players in the USSR are very privileged people’. But later, after he had left, he lamented: ‘Eleven years of normal life were lost.’ It cannot be denied that a lack of opportunities to take part in worthy tournaments is very damaging to any out¬ standing player who is at the height of his powers. And so in 1965, by his own admis¬ sion, Korchnoi had reached the end of his tether: ‘I decided to join the Communist Party — as a last chance of easing my lot. And in¬ deed, initially it helped.’ A great stir was caused at that time by Korchnoi’s double win over Petrosian in the traditional Moscow-Leningrad match (Mos¬ cow, November 1965). After adjourning the first game in a complicated middlegame, the two players began the second the following day. Tigran Vartanovich began with 1 e4 — a rare instance! ‘Obviously, preparing for the coming match for the world championship, he was aiming to broaden his opening repertoire,’ decided Korchnoi, who replied with the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After White’s 21st move a sharp situation arose. Game 13 T.Petrosian-V. Korchnoi Moscow v. Leningrad Match, 1965 ‘Here I thought for half an hour,’ writes Korchnoi. ‘How to parry the knight move to f5? If 21 ...g6 there follows 22 f4 with the prac¬ tically forced continuation 22...h5 23 f5 hxg4 24 fxe6 S.xh4. In my mind I returned several times to this critical position. Black appears to have an attack, but the position did not appeal to me because of its ‘irrationality’, the fact that it was impossible to decide whom it favoured. And yet I realised that after other continua¬ tions White would have an advantage. In a chess player’s thinking, a major role is played by psychological factors. He is often guided not by objective evaluations, but his own sub¬ jective feelings, those that he can allow him¬ self. Tal would definitely have gone in for this continuation, but I avoided it, because the character of the resulting play was not to my taste. After lengthy thought, hesitations and doubts, I answered differently.’ 21...#06 22 f4 (22 £}f5 h5!) 22...d4+ 23 54 Viktor the Terrible #g2 ®xg2+ 24 £lxg2 dxc3 with a compli¬ cated ending. Things ended in a time scram¬ ble, where the last mistake was made by Pet¬ rosian. Tin his games with me the nerves of the great strategist often let him down/ This re¬ mark says everything about Korchnoi’s char¬ acter! The game was adjourned in a rook ending that was hopeless for White, and on the resumption he resigned within a few moves. That same day Korchnoi also won the second game. The master A.Geller recalls: Wiktor gained particular satisfaction from the analysis of games. During the double-round Moscow- Leningrad match on 40 boards, the leader of the visiting team, who had two adjournments with Petrosian, spent a sleepless night analys¬ ing several dozen adjourned games of his team-mates, which, however, did not prevent him from winning his two games against the world champion the following morning. Gen¬ erally speaking, during analysis Korchnoi had the ability to instantly “cut into” the position and quickly find the strongest reply — in this sense he is similar to Alekhine/ Of Korchnoi’s tournament performances in 1966 the most memorable were his victories in Bucharest (\2XA out of 14!), in the Chigorin Memorial in Sochi (IIV2 out of 15), and the best result on the first reserve board at the Olympiad in Havana (IOV2 out of 13). As usual, he was assisted by the French Defence — for Viktor the Terrible this is truly an open¬ ing for all times! The following game gives a good illustration of his manner of play. Game 14 D.Minic-V.

However, against Minic a year later in the Yugoslavia-USSR match (Budva 1967) he chose the solid 7...0-0! 8 (nowadays White’s hopes are associated with 8 Jtd3!?) 8...^bc6 9 ±d3 f5 10 exf6 fixf6 11 ±g5 (11 Wh5?! h6 12 0-0 c4! 13 ±e2 Wa5 14 ±d2 Jtd7 15 Sfbl ®c7 leads to equality, Mecking- Korchnoi, Wijk aan Zee 1978) ll...flf7 12 Wh5 g6 and the players agreed a draw, al¬ though after 13 Wi4 c4 14 JLe2 HaS 15 id2 ^3f5 16 ®g5 Jtd7 the position is still full of fight (Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, Linares 1985). 8 Wxg7 2g8 9 #xh7 cxd4 Black declares his readiness to launch a counterattack at the first opportunity. A very sharp position has arisen, where neither king feels entirely comfortable and the borders be¬ tween defence and attack are blurred. And those who go in for these complications (irre¬ spective of whether with White or Black) take on a considerable strategic risk. 10 <4?d1 An original if bizarre move, the fashion for which was set by Tal in the 1st game of his 1960 match with Botvinnik (true, there it was 6.. .Wc7 7 %4 £5 8 %3 £k7 9 Wxgl Bg8 10 1fch7 cxd4 11 rsfrdl!? that occurred — Volume 2} Game No. 127) and then also by Bronstein. White wants to play 4lf3 and then a possible 4lg5, in contrast to the usual variation with 10 £le2 £)bc6 11 f4 (GameNo.27). 10.. .6bc6! 55 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 10...4}d7 11 4\f3 narrows Black’s choice to 11.. .4hxe5 (cf. the following note), since he can hardly equalise with 11...4k5 12 4^g5 or 11.. .6ffi 12 Wd3 dxc3 (12...#xc3? 13 #xd4) 13 Sbl etc. 11 4bf3 dxc3 Avoiding the dangerous variation 11...4ixe5 12 Af4 Wxc3 13 4ixe5 'fflfxalH- 14 Jtcl d3l?

An attempted improvement The game Minic-Ivkov (Titograd 1965) went 12 flbl jtd7 13 Jtg5 0-0-0 with equality, while after 12 Jtf4 (Kuijpers-Padevsky, Moscow 1963) there is the good reply 12...tfb6! 12.. .Hf8 A comparatively modest reply. Unclear, ir¬ rational play results after 12...Wxe5 13 ®xf7+ <4)d7 (but not 13...<4,d8? 14 ®xg8+ 4^xg8 15 4^f7+ and 4^xe5, Minic-Zinn, Halle Zonal 1967) or 12...^xe5 13 £4 (13 Af4 Wb6!) 13.. .5xg5!? (13...f6 has also been played) 14 fxg5 4^5g6 and 15...e5!, and the powerful pawn centre, together with the sorry position of the enemy king, gives Black every reason for optimism (Adorjan-Portisch, Hungarian Championship 1966), as well as the newly fashionable 12...4M8!? 13 f4 ±d7 (Short- Neelotpal, Dhaka 1999). The move in the game allows White to de¬ fend his e5-pawn, bring back his queen and pick up the c3-pawn, with his knight not at e2, but at g5, which is obviously more promising. But, on the other hand, the white king, having moved to dl, can no longer take shelter on the kingside and Black has a plan involving queenside castling and the rapid opening up of the centre. 13 f4 ±d7 14#d3 Little is promised by 14 Jld3 Wb 6 (O’Kelly-Pietzsch, Havana 1965). At the board Korchnoi thought that 14 flbl would have been more unpleasant for him; to this they later replied 14,..4^a5 (Pietrusiak- Uhlmann, Halle Zonal 1967). 14...0-0-0 (not 14...4M8?! or 14...d4?! on account of 15 4ih7) 15 #xc3 <4^8 The immediate 15...d41? 16 Wc5 4id5 and ...f7-f6 w^as perhaps better. 16 Hbl (16 a4!?

An imperceptible, but serious inaccuracy, which loses an important tempo — the rook is firing into empty space. Both sides would still have had chances after 23 g4 (Korchnoi) with the idea of 23...

After this he has tried both 3...£k6 and 3...£if6, but most often he has played 3...c5 and incurred an iso¬ lated d5-pawn. In the following classic game he convincingly demonstrates Black’s main trump in such positions — active piece play, even without the queens. Game 15 A. Matanovic-V.

This was played back in 1950 by Laszlo Szabo. ‘Here I think that Matanovic was genu¬ inely surprised: it is hard to believe that Black, with an isolated d5-pawn, is himself offering the exchange of queens...’ (Korchnoi). Espe¬ cially since a previous duel between the same opponents (Havana Olympiad 1966) went 8.. .£)c6 9 0-0 with a slight advantage for White. 9#e2 Or 9 ±t2 ®if6 10 0-0 0-0 11 £>fd4 (11 ±g5!?

But the d5-pawn as though hyp¬ notises Matanovic. After all, in the endgame ‘ this is a weakness, a convenient target! And he, thinking that he has an advantage, looks for ways to convert it. Meanwhile, Black does not experience any difficulties. His pieces are harmoniously and actively placed, aimed at the central squares. In such a situation the d5- pawn is not a weakness, but a strength!’ (Korchnoi) 16 g4?! ‘And here is the consequence of White overestimating his chances. Matanovic wants to switch his light-squared bishop to g2, but in so doing he weakens his ldngside pawns — subsequently it will be this factor that leads to his defeat,’ writes Korchnoi, adding that after 16 jtfl he would probably have played 16.. .5e4.

Korchnoi called this the best of the numerous games played by him in the given variation. Belief in the solidity of ‘French’ positions with an isolated d5-pawn is a recurrent theme throughout Korchnoi’s career. To some ex¬ tent he was following the principle of Bron- stein, formulated back in the match with Bot- vinnik (1951): with accurate play the ‘isolani’ can be held! Indeed, Korchnoi did not lose a single ‘French’ in his matches with Karpov (1974 and 1978). But objectively it must be said that at times he had to engage in a lengthy and stubborn defence in rather dubious posi¬ tions. In the chapter on Karpov we will see how subdy the latter handled them for White (Game Nos. 52 and 53). Scheveningen Experiences Korchnoi began the next world championship cycle with the Zonal, 34th USSR Champion¬ ship (Tbilisi 1966/67). On this occasion he stuck to a purely rational tournament strategy, 60 Viktor the Terrible aiming for one of the four qualifying places. But, despite being undefeated, he did not im¬ mediately achieve this objective: 1. Stein — 13 out of 20; 2. Geller — I2V2; 3-5. Gipslis, Korchnoi and Taimanov — 12, etc. To sift out the ‘superfluous fifth5 an addi¬ tional double-round match-tournament of three players had to be held (Tallinn 1967). That was a difficult test! Taimanov drew all four of his games, while Korchnoi and Gipslis beat each other, as a result of which all three scored 2 out of 4. The fifth turned out to be Taimanov, who had an inferior coefficient in the main tournament. However, it could all have turned out differ- endy, since Korchnoi won against Gipslis liter¬ ally by a miracle. My attention was also drawn to the opening stage of this dramatic game. Game 16 V.Korchnoi-A. Gipslis Match-tournament, Tallinn 1967 English Opening A30 1 c4 Playing White, Korchnoi always preferred the closed games, and he normally opened 1 e4 only as an experiment and when he had made purposeful preparations for a specific opponent.

Nevertheless, 30 years ago and earlier, masters (whose understanding of chess was hardly inferior to that of modem masters) presented things as follows: “The side who is cramped has difficulty manoeuvring his pieces.55 But the founders of die “hedgehog55 set-up — which is a fully viable participant in present-day events — modified the formula: “The side who has occupied space has prob¬ lems widi the defence of his outposts.55 In the case of the “hedgehog55 — with the defence of the c4- and e4-pawns. On occasions I too have played the “hedgehog55 — when I have been desperate to win as Black. But in princi¬ ple both Gipslis and I are players with a classi¬ cal approach to chess strategy, and we don’t recognise hedgehog insidiousness!5 (For more details about the ‘hedgehog5, see the next vol¬ ume.) 11 e5?l £id7! 12 cxd5 £tt)4 13 We4?! £ixd5, and by the 30th move a minor piece ending arose with an extra pawn and winning chances for Gipslis, but in a wild time scram¬ ble he did not manage to make his 40th move, the last one before the time control! Regarding this, Korchnoi commented: 1 do not like the formulae, often used by commentators — “crucial game55, “war of nerves55, “mass of mistakes55 — but it is hard to explain otherwise this theatrical parade of minor errors and vex¬ ing mistakes, concluding in suicide, or rather — losing on time.5 Very soon Korchnoi brilliantly demon¬ strated that he had rightfully qualified for the Interzonal tournament. In May 1967, in hon¬ our of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, the USSR simultaneously staged two major international tournaments — a su¬ perstar event in Moscow (won by Stein) and a 61 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors more modest one in Leningrad. Of course, Viktor Lvovich had every right to play in Moscow, but to ‘strengthen the field’ they obliged him to play in Leningrad. The effect was impressive: 1. Korchnoi — 13 out of 16 (+10=6); 2. Kholmov — 12; 3-4. Barcza and Taimanov — 10 Vi, etc. ‘Korchnoi’s score is exceptionally high, but for him this is by no means a rarity/ wrote V.Osnos and P.Kondratiev in the Riga maga¬ zine Shakhmaty. ‘It is well known that competi¬ tive form, on which so much depends, cannot remain constant for long. And it has some¬ times happened that the outstanding Lenin¬ grad grandmaster’s greatest successes have been achieved, so to speak, at the “wrong” time. And at the most important moments, i.e. the FIDE qualifying events, he has been “in a recession”. Thus in the 34th USSR Champi¬ onship and the subsequent play-off his per¬ formance was only “satisfactory”. But in Len¬ ingrad Korchnoi’s play improved from one round to the next It is to be hoped that this tendency will prove enduring, and that he will arrive for the forthcoming Interzonal tourna¬ ment in good form... Korchnoi has always been faithful to his unusual, inimitable style. A classic example of his creative credo when playing Black (at first defence, if possible with the acquisition of material, and then counter¬ attack) is provided by his game with Suetin.’ The account of this game requires a short introduction. Whereas Korchnoi’s contribu¬ tion to the theory of the French Defence and the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez is well known, many players, especially the young, do not have the slightest suspicion that he was responsible for some important developments in the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Against Kholmov (Moscow Zonal 1964) after 1 e4 c5 2 GX3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 £>xd4 5 d6 6 Ae2 Ael 7 0-0 0-0 8 Ae3 <S^c6 9 f4 he employed what has long since become a classic plan for the first time - 9...±d7 10 Wei £>xd4 11 ±,xd4 Ac6. After 12 Wg3 Black made the key move 12.. .g6. Such a kingside weakening seems inadmissible, but Korchnoi established that it is hard for White to exploit and that Black has sufficient time to set up counterplay on the queenside. In addition. White has a weak pawn at e4 (or, if it should advance, at e5).

Only 16 5! 17 Wf2 (Korchnoi) could have disclosed the drawbacks of his set-up. In similar structures the f4-f5 breakthrough be¬ came typical. A vivid example is Karpov- Hiibner (Bad Kissingen 1980). I remember my first "Scheveningen’ les¬ sons, given in the Baku Pioneers Palace by Oleg Privorotsky. It was these games that he showed me: at that time everyone was brought up on the games of the strongest Soviet play¬ ers of the 1950s and 1960s. Oleg Isaakovich taught us: As Korchnoi has shown, after 9...iLd7 10 Wei £>xd4 11 J,xd4 ±c6 Black has nothing to fear, so therefore White should play 10 £}b3!’ However, other ways of deviat¬ ing also occurred, and one of them was dem¬ onstrated by Suetin.

The game Sakharov-Krogius (32nd USSR Championship, Kiev 1964/65), where the plan with 9 Wd2 originated, went 9...a6 10 0-0-0 Wc7 11 g4! with the initiative for White, which in principle was confirmed by subsequent practice. Towards the end of the century 10.. .^3d7 11 g4 <53xd4 became popular. And yet the best method of equalising is consid¬ ered to be the immediate counter in the centre 9.. .e5! (Kupreichik-Kasparov, Kislovodsk 1982). 10 jkxd4 jtd7 11 e5 (otherwise ll...jtc6, and the knight is not forced to retreat to e8) 11 ...dxe5 12 fxe5 ®e8 13 0-0 "A quieter continuation than the double- edged 13 0-0-0.

But if Black should manage to solve the problem of his "bad’ knight at e8, this advantage will evaporate. 13.. .11.6 14 Uadi 14.. .Wa5!

An uncommonly paradoxical defence: at that time it was somehow not con¬ sidered acceptable to make such pawn moves away from the king. But Black wants finally to bring his knight into play by ...g7-g6 and .„<53g7-f5, and White will not have the typical restricting move g2-g4. With this same aim 20...g6 was not bad — 21 flh3 h5 and ...<S3g7 for example, but then White could have nailed down the pawn at h7 by 21 'tth6, although after 21 ...f6 (21...^3g7?! is hardly acceptable: 22 fih3 ^h5 23 fidd3!

Suetin spent a lot of time, but he was unable to create any serious threats on the kingside, weakened by the advance of the h-pawn, and Black gained 64 Viktor the Terrible sufficient counterplay. True, he always had to remember that the absence of the pawn from h7, together with the weakened f6-square, which the white knight was eagerly eyeing, was a potential source of problems, and after the slightest error these problems could become insoluble. 21 flfl (21 We2l? and flgd3) 21...#b4 22 2 ®c4 23 c3 g6 24 Sgf3 ®g7 25 b3 Wfa6 26 £ig3 h4 27 ®e4 ®f5 28 Wf4 Wxa2 "Only when the knight has become estab¬ lished at f5, where it covers the immediate approaches to its king, does Black venture to take the a2-pawn.’ (Osnos, Kondratiev) 29 Ac5 ‘A tempting move, but it does not promise White more than a draw. 29 g4 hxg3 30 hxg3 4>g7 31 g4 Sh8+ (31...ZhxM 32 ^b3! - G.K) 32 igl ffh4 would have led to complicated and unclear play.’ (Osnos, Kondratiev).

The h-pawn looked to be a weakness, but it has proved to be a strength, since it prevents White from freeing his king by g2-g3. And since his king is in con- 65 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors stant danger, it is hard for him to create any effective counterplay. 38 jk,b6 39 £rf2?

The battle for the six qualifying places in the Can¬ didates matches was incredibly dramatic. Korchnoi was aiming only to qualify, alternat¬ ing draws with occasional wins — over Kavalek, Byrne, Larsen... But after losing in the 15th and 17th rounds to Ivkov and Matu- lovic, he slipped down to "plus two’ and ap¬ peared to have lost any chance of success. However, five successive wins, including one over Portisch (who was IV2 points ahead), helped him to repair the situation: 1. Larsen — 15V2 out of 21; 2-4. Geller, Gligoric and Korchnoi - 14; 5. Portisch - 13/4; 6-8. Hort, Reshevsky and Stein — 13, etc. Soon afterwards, now among the ranks of the Candidates, he gained the first, and proba¬ bly the most staggering of his four victories in Wijk aan Zee (January 1968): 1. Korchnoi — 12 out of 15; 2-4. Hort, Portisch and Tal — 9; 5. Gheorghiu - 8V2; 6-7. Ciric and Matanovic - 8, etc. His start - 8 out of 8, then IOV2 out of 11 (4 points ahead of his nearest rivals) - could have been the envy of Fischer himself! As the Moscow weekly 64 reported, at that time a letter arrived in Belgrade from grand¬ master Trifunovic: ‘Such a superiority fright¬ ens even me, an old tournament fox. Is it pos¬ sible that everyone, apart from Korchnoi, has forgotten how to play chess?’ And this is what the European press wrote: ‘Many times earlier we have witnessed brilliant victories by Korchnoi. It can be said with cer¬ tainty: when Korchnoi plays abroad, he always finishes first... His triumph in Wijk aan Zee is comparable with Alekhine’s achievement in San Remo (1930).’ Apart from anything else, this was the fruit of enormous labour: Korchnoi made 607 moves in the tournament — more than any other contestant (thus Gheorghiu made do with 345). Few were surprised to see him gain another win over Tal. But, in my opinion, it is worth noting Korchnoi’s self-critical attitude in his evaluation of the turning point of this game. Game 18 V.Korchnoi-M.Tal _Wijk aan Zee 1968, 8th round_ 19 ^xe6?! fxe6? White made this exchange, since he did not see any way to strengthen his position. But the exchange too should not have brought him 66 Viktor the Terrible any particular benefits. After 19...'ttfxe6 White could hardly count on an advantage: his bish¬ ops have no scope/ wrote Korchnoi in 1968, but in 1995 he firmly added: '27 years after the conclusion of the game I should be more frank: in the event of ^..."ffxeti, in view of the terrible position of the bishop at b2, White’s position is close to being lost/ 20 c4! (Tal had overlooked this) 20...£ixc4 The computer prefers 20...fixc5 21 jtxe5 Bcc8, but according to Korchnoi after 22 Jtxb8 Bxb8 23 ttb3 White has an obvious positional advantage/ The light-squared bishop against a knight — Fischer’s favourite combination... 21 J>xf6 gxf6 22 ±xc4 dxc4 23 ®g4+ 4>h8 24 Wd4 (24 Wxc4!?) 24...#d8 25 *xc4 Bxc5 26 bxc5 Wd7?l (26...Wd5 was more tenacious — Korchnoi) 27 Wf4, and Black resigned on the 59th move (1 -0). Also interesting is Korchnoi’s comment on his game with Ciric (10th round), after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 £ic3 £lf6 4 &gS &e7 5 e3 0-0 6 Bel!? h6 7 ±h4 b6 8 Axf6 &xf6 9 cxd5 exd5 10 g3: 'I don’t know whether this position had occurred earlier, but Ciric considers the move 10 g3 and the plan associ¬ ated with it to be my invention. Later I several times employed the variation with 6 Bel, which proved to be very strong against the T artakower-Makogonov-Bondarevsky D e- fence. For the match in Merano (1981), in¬ stead of 7...b6 Karpov “with his comrades” prepared the strong move 7...dxc4!’ (Game No. 84). That year Korchnoi finally made a spurt towards the summit, winning his Candidates matches against Reshevsky (5 Vi-2 Vi) and Tal (5Vi-4Vi). But then he lost to Spassky (3Vi- 6Vi) and, having effectively become the No.3 player in the world, he gained the right to par¬ ticipate in the next cycle without having to qualify. All these encounters were annotated in detail by the participants themselves in a splendid book, published in Belgrade in 1969. After his defeat in the final, Viktor Lvovich admitted that his opponent had played more strongly, particularly in the middlegame, and with his customary objectivity he explained: 'For every opponent Spassky selects that weapon which is not to the player’s taste. I think that when preparing for our match he outlined the type of battle needed, in order to impose the most unpleasant manner of play on me. For this it was sufficient for him to look through a dozen games of mine against players with a waiting style and to sense how uncertainly I play against them. Indeed, I did not once succeed in genuinely breaching Spassky’s defence/ (cf. also the start of the chapter The Storming of Olympus’ in Vol¬ ume 3). During the two and a half years till the next Candidates matches, Korchnoi achieved a whole series of top-class results: at the end of 1968 he won a super-tournament in Mallorca (+10=6, ahead of Spassky, Larsen and Petro¬ sian); in 1969 he won a further three interna¬ tional tournaments, and in Mallorca he shared 3rd-4th places; in 1970 he distinguished him¬ self in Rovinj/Zagreb (a share of 2nd-6th places with Fischer) and in the 38th USSR Championship in Riga, where he very confi¬ dently won his fourth gold medal (+12—1=8). And he began 1971 with another victory in Wijk aan Zee. His present-day evaluations of his own comments on the games of that period are, as usual, sharp and self-critical. For example, on his game with Hiibner (Wijk aan Zee 1971): These notes are more like a conversation with a journalist than a serious piece of work, but the game is interesting.’ Or his win over Spassky (Palma de Mallorca 1968) — at the time after his 20th move he wrote: 'Although White’s position is better, Black maintains the balance. After 20...d5 21 cxd5 cxd5 22 e5 there are few real chances of winning.’ But now he frankly admitted: 'A weak commen¬ tary — from beginning to end. The first sen¬ tence is meaningless: what is the real state of 67 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors affairs - is White better or is the position bal¬ anced?! But in the given variation, thanks to the weakness of Black’s queenside pawns. White stands better.’ Korchnoi’s opponent in the 1971 Candi¬ dates quarter-final match was the highly ex¬ perienced Efim Geller (cf. the chapter ‘Pet¬ rovich — threat to the champions’ in Volume 2). In the first game he employed his favourite King’s Indian Defence, but against Korchnoi this was not the best choice. Geller’s position became increasingly difficult, he got into se¬ vere time-trouble, and on move 36 he over¬ stepped the time limit ‘A defeat at the start is always unpleasant, since you are immediately in the position of having to catch up (this comment was made by Geller himself at the conclusion of the match). Perhaps this factor affected Geller’s play, which was laboured and with long periods of thought, in nearly all the remaining games of the match,’ wrote V.Osnos and G.Sosonko, the assistants of the Leningrad grandmaster. But there was still much fight to come. In the even-numbered games Geller played only 1 e4, and Korchnoi employed only the Sicilian Defence: in the 2nd and 4th games — the Dragon Variation (not without success), and in the 6th and 8th he presented his ‘Scheveningen experiences’. I should remind you that it was a match of ten games, and after his win in the 7th Korchnoi was leading 4Y2- 2lA Thus the 8th game was practically Geller’s last chance of saving the match. The nervous tension had reached its peak. Game 19 E.Geller-V.

But the modern move 14 g4! is more ener¬ getic, giving White better chances of casting doubts on Black’s defensive construction: 68 Viktor the Terrible 14..Jte8 (now after 14...d5 15 e5 Black does not have 15...5ie4, while if 15...?ie8, then 16 Wc2) 15 g5 5id7 16 ±g2 etc. 14.. .±e8 15 ±f2 fidc8!?

A move that evokes memories of the game with Suetin {Game No.17), especially since here 69 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Black does not have the ‘bad’ knight at e8. ‘Such a defence is typical of Korchnoi’s style in general, but here it is also objectively the best possibility, although it runs counter to a well-known axiom: don’t advance pawns on the part of the board where you are weaker.’ (Gufeld) In the opinion of Rohr, a grandmaster of traditionally classical style, ‘by 22..:5^f8 Black would have achieved a perfectly sound posi¬ tion and after 23 h4 a complicated struggle would have developed.’ However, here, in my view, the evaluation of Gufeld (Geller’s sec¬ ond) is more accurate: ‘In all variations White has a powerful initiative. He is threatening to intensify the pressure by h4-h5.’ 23 2e4 g6 ‘After 23...h4 24 A£2 Black has a difficult position.’ (Gufeld). Korchnoi set his opponent a difficult psychological problem (moreover, with him short of time): now White’s attack must definitely be accompanied by sacrifices. And Geller sank into agonising thought.. 24 h3 The commenljators unanimously con¬ demned this move and attached a question mark to it. fit is surprising that such a splendid tactician as Geller marks time and in the end loses the battle, missing the excellent oppor¬ tunity 24 JtxhS!? gxh5 25 fi£6!, when it would be hard even for the great Korchnoi to find a defence.’ (Rohr).

(after 25 Wxh5? f5! 26 ®h6 ^f8 his hopes are dashed) 25...exd5 with very interesting complications: 1) 26 flg4+P! (26 e6?

Thus, after 24 Axh5 gxh5 there appears to be no decisive continuation of the attack for White, but for several more moves the threat of the bishop sacrifice is in the air. To take such a risk, considerable courage is demanded of the player with Black — I would say, the courage of a tightrope walker, when one false step can lead to disaster. But Korchnoi keenly sensed that his opponent was in such a nerv¬ ous state, that he would find it especially diffi¬ cult to take committing decisions involving material sacrifices. 24.. .±f8 Another interesting moment Geller again had much to think about. 25 ±h2 For some reason no one mentioned 25 jtxh5!? gxh5 26 Jth4! with the threat of Jtf6 (and if 26...<£k5?, then 27 Hg4+!S), although this would have set Black even more difficult problems than the sacrifice on the previous move. After 26...£5 27 exf6 Jtf7 28 Hf3 White’s attack looks very dangerous. Let us also examine moves with the queen: 1) 26...Wb8 27 ±{6 <£>xf6 28 Ixf6 ±g7 29 #xh5 Sc5 30 Wg5 <4>f8 31 b4! ±xf6 (31...flxc3? 32 Hg4) 32 Hbsffi fixc3, and al¬ though after 33 flh4 flg3 34 Sh8+ fig8 35 th6+ 4>e7 36 Sxg8 fla8 or 33 <4>h2! He3! (otherwise Hh4) 34 Bxe3 fld7 Black has a bishop for two pawns, his defence is difficult (the decisive word may be said by the passed h-pawn); 2) 26...trc5! 27 SB! ±h6 (27...±g7? 28 Hg3 with the threat of Hxg7+! and Hfxh5) 28 Ig3+ <4>h7 29 &g5!

After Geller’s rejection of the piece sacri¬ fice, Black succeeds in consolidating his posi¬ tion, and the battle continues at a more meas¬ ured pace, without straying beyond the bounds of approximate equality. 25...Jtg7 26 Se3 £ic5 27 «e1 *Why does White give ground? Here too 27 71 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors jtxhS gxh5? 28 Bf6 would have given him an irresistible attack.’ (Gufeld). However, in my opinion, the cool-headed 28...1?M7! 29 Hfxh5 <S^f8 and ...?ig6 (a familiar manoeuvre!) par¬ ries the attack, and therefore 28 flg3! is stronger, for example: 28...<4’f8 29 flg5! 1&C6 (29...4ixa4 is also insufficient — 30 ®xh5) 30 lxg7! <4>xg7 31 Wxh5 Id7 32 %5+ <A>f8'33 ffii6+ *g8 34 flf4, or 33...*e7 34 #f6+ 4>f8 35 Jtf4, mating. ‘True, Black can play 27...<S3xa4, when White has merely a minimal advantage,’ adds Gufeld. But, according to the computer, here the two sides’ chances are equal. 27...±c6 28 ±xc6 ‘Either now or on the previous move JtxhS was essential, when the picture would still have remained unclear.’ (Flohr). Alas, 28 jtxh5?l was now too late: 28....gxh5 29 ®h4 ®d8 (29...We7!? with the idea of ...4!M7-f8-g6) 30 WxhS Wd2! (30...£W!?) 31 Sg3 (31 fle2 ®h6 and wins) 31...Wxc2 32 a5 ^e4! 33 flg4 (if 33 lxg7+ *xg7 34 Wg4+ 4>f8 35 axb6, then 35...Wf2!!) 33...£ixc3 34 axb6 Ib7 35 bxc3 Wh7! 36 *g5 flxb6 37 »f6 Ib7 and Black wins. 28..J?xc6 29 »h4 Sd7 30 Hef3 b5l ‘Korchnoi launches a counterattack. Calm has descended on the kingside and, as often happens in the Sicilian Defence, the batde is decided on the queenside in favour of Black.’ (Flohr) 31 axb5 axb5 32 b4?! ‘A decisive positional mistake.’ (Gufeld). This is probably an exaggeration, although 32 Jlg3 was indeed sounder, with a roughly equal game. 32.. .£id3! 33 £ie4 Because of the match situation Geller needed at the least to retain some complica¬ tions, and with his flag about to fall he avoids the depressing 33 Sxd3 Bxd3 34 cxd3 Wxc3 — here, with his ‘bad’ bishop and weak pawns, the limit of White’s dreams is a draw: 35 We4 Hc7 or 35 Wcl Wcl\ 36 Ixf7?! (36 Hd6 ±f8) 36.. 3.xe7 37 Bxe7 flcl+ 38 Agl ±xe5 39 B.xe6 jtd4 40 Bxg6+ etc. 33.. 3.xc2 34 4if6 + ? ‘This is equivalent to capitulation. 34 <§3d6 was essential, when Black has a choice: to give up the exchange by 34...Sc4 or, which is stronger, himself attack with 34.. JSa8 followed by ...fia2.’ (Flohr) The second suggestion is dubious in view of 35 ^xf7! la2 36 %5 ^xb4?! 37 iLgl! But 34.. .flc4! (34...^xe5 35 Jtxe5 JtxeS 36 ^xc8 Wxc8 is equal) 35 <S^xc4 Wxc4 36 ®xc4 (36 *g5 #xb4 37 ffe3 #c5!) 36...bxc4 37 fial (not 37 b5? c3) 37...^xb4 (37...^xe5 38 Sc3!) 38 Bc3 <$M3 39 flxc4 ^3xe5 would have left Black with a symbolic advantage. 34.. .jtxf6 35 exf6 Hd5 (easily parrying the only threat of Wg5-h6) 36 Be3 ®c4 (36...Wd2!) 37 #g3? The last grimace of time-trouble. However, 72 Viktor the Terrible after 37 He4 both 37...&G+ 38 Hxf2 fidl+ 39 jtgl »cl (Flohr) and 37..."4tc3! 38 Jtg3 JSc4 or 38 ®g3 Hf5 39 flxf5 exf5 40 fie2 f4 would have been decisive. 37...h4 0-1 Here Geller overstepped the time limit (for the third time in the match!) and Korchnoi won 5V2-2V2. The semi-final match with Petrosian was uncommonly tough, viscous and unspectacu¬ lar: nine draws and one win for the ex-world champion. The stakes were high, like never before: which of the Soviet stars would be able to oppose the irrepressible Fischer in the final? Petrosian was unable. However, at that time it is also unlikely that Korchnoi would have been able to stop the American... In a satirical New Year story ‘Match of the eras’, published in 64y great players from the past met our contemporaries, and each of them chose an opponent with a similar style. Korchnoi happened to be paired with... Emanuel Lasker! Well, such a comparison is quite appropriate. After all, Korchnoi himself once wrote: Tn his time Lasker remarked that with equal forces on the board the game is rarely interesting and usually ends in a dr&w. A player who does not like draws (and I am one of them) must somehow disturb the balance. Either he sacrifices something and thanks to this seizes the initiative, or he allows the op¬ ponent to attack, as compensation creating some weaknesses in his position, which he subsequendy hopes to exploit. I like to entice my opponent fin this way.’ This very much resembles Lasker’s manner of play. This continuity is also indicated by small details, such as Korchnoi’s comment on his game with Giorgadze (Batumi 1999), where after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 <?3c3 his opponent re¬ plied 3..Jtb4: 1 don’t rate this move too highly. The old rule “develop your knights first!”, told to us by Emanuel Lasker more than 100 years ago, has still not lost its valid¬ ity.’ Before and after the Escape It was precisely at that time that Korchnoi’s rivalry began with the young, rapidly progress¬ ing Anatoly Karpov. They had met back in 1969, when Karpov moved to Leningrad and his regular trainer became grandmaster Semion Furman, who had worked for many years with Korchnoi. The first serious game between them, in the 1970 USSR Champion¬ ship, ended in the defeat of the debutant, who, however, drew a useful lesson from this: ‘Af¬ ter analysing the course of the game, I realised this: before games with Korchnoi I should not rely on Furman’s opening advice. During the years of their collaboration, Korchnoi had studied Furman and he would guess almost faultlessly not only the opening, but also the line which the game would follow. How many times did I notice this! But he was no longer able to catch me unawares, because, after lis¬ tening to my trainer, I would go my own way.’ But in 1971, shortly before his Candidates battle with Geller, Viktor Lvovich played a training match with Karpov (for Korchnoi this was a well-tried way of preparing: in 1970 his sparring-partner was Bronstein, in 1973 — Hiibner, and in 1976 — Timman). In five of the six games Karpov had White and in one he had Black. The result of this fierce domes¬ tic battle was 3-3 (+2—2=2). An excellent schooling for the 20-year-old grandmaster! However, in Karpov’s opinion, ‘Korchnoi also profited from the match: after making some corrections to his preparations, he crushed Geller practically without allowing any chances.’ Soon the two rivals exchanged painful blows: three rounds from the end of the Alekhine Memorial tournament (1971) Kar¬ pov won and as a result became one of the tournament winners, while Korchnoi won the decisive game in the penultimate round at Hastings (1971/72), where, scoring 11 out of 15, they shared first place. Not only Hastings, but also the whole of 1972 turned out to be rather difficult for 73 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Korchnoi. ‘There was not a single event where I played easily/ he admitted in an interview for 64, ‘I was forced literally to “bend over back¬ wards” in order to achieve my aims. My re¬ sults were decent, but were inferior to those of 1969, which I consider to be my best year" (probably, also taking account of Mallorca in December 1968). Nevertheless, for the Interzonal tourna¬ ment in Leningrad (May-June 1973) Korchnoi arrived in excellent form — and he started with 8 out of 9! This included a substantial 4 out of 5 against his compatriots (because of the compulsory pairings, the Soviets contestants played against one another in the first few rounds). It was thought that his main rivals in the battle for the three Candidates places would be Larsen, Tal and Karpov. Alas, Tal began with a draw and three de¬ feats, and in the 6th round he also lost with White against Korchnoi after the modest 1 £lf3 £lf6 2 c4 b6 3 g3 c5 4 Ag2 Ab7 5 0-0 g6 6 b3 Ag7 7 Ab2 (later this was christened the ‘Four Bishops Opening’). But Larsen, burning with a desire to rehabilitate himself after the crushing defeat in his match with Fischer (cf. the chapter ‘Battle in Denver’ in Volume 4), did indeed immediately surge ahead and take the lead — 5Vi out of 6! In the 7th round he drew, and he was caught by Korchnoi. The next day saw the gripping encounter of the two leaders, which had a great influence on the subsequent course of the tournament. Game 20 B.Larsen-V. Korchnoi Interzonal Tournament, Leningrad 1973, 8th round _'English Opening A20_ 1 c4 e5 2 g3 (2 4ic3 allows set-ups with „.kb4, but now Black can undertake activity in the centre) 2...c6 3 ^f3 More is promised by 3 d4 (Korchnoi him¬ self played this in a match with Bacrot... in 1997!), but Larsen plays the opening in his favourite manner, provoking ...e5-e4. Previ¬ ously he had felt very comfortable in such non-standard set-ups. 3.. .e4 4 £>d4 d5 5 cxd5 #xd5!? ‘Paul Keres used to prefer 5...cxd5 or 5.. .^f6 6 £k3 Wb6 7 4ib3 cxd5.1 twice failed to gain an advantage with White against Keres.

Comparing the resulting position with the well-known varia¬ tion 1 e4 c5 2 c3 3 e5 £M5 4 d4 cxd4 5 ®xd4, where 5...e6 is considered best, Korchnoi declares 6 e3 to be more promising.

I was more afraid of 10 0-0 Jtd6 11 d3 exd3 12 e4,’ writes Korchnoi. At the board he calculated the variation 12.. .41.5! 13 f4 #xg3 14 fxe5 JLxeS?! and did not see the reply 14...jtxh3! 15 HT3 ®xg2+ 16 1§xg2 Jtxg2, which would have placed White on the verge of defeat: 17 flxf6 gxf6 18 exd6 ag8 19 <±>f2 h5! or 17 <&xg2 JhteS 18 flfBP! (18 ilg5 is more tenacious) 18...^g4! etc. I should mention that 13 4h2? (instead of 13 f4?) is also bad: 13...h5! 14 f4 h4 15 g4 Jkxg4! with a powerful attack for Black. It would appear that here White must play 13 ilf4 0-0 14 jtxe5 jtxe5 15 ®xd3, thinking only about equality. 10.. .e3 11 #xg6 exf2+! (after U...exd2+?! 12 jtxd2 hxg6 Black’s task is more difficult) 12*xf2hxg6 13d4 ‘White engages in an open batde. The pawn centre that he now erects is a strength of his position, but it also demands constant de¬ fence. The modest 13 d3 came into considera¬ tion.’ (Korchnoi) 13.. .£>b6 14 e4 ±e6 Korchnoi was obviously hoping that he would be able to put pressure on the e4- and d4-pawns — after all, he had often succeeded with such counterattacks in the Griinfeld De¬ fence. Here too, in the end, this plan justified itself, although not without Larsen’s assistance. 15±f4 Subsequently 15 <S3c5 0-0-0?! 16 43xe6 fxe6 occurred in the game Smagin-Naumkin (Mos¬ cow 1984), and here 17 e5! with the idea of Jte4 would have given White an appreciable advantage. Therefore 15...Axc5 16 dxc5 <S3c4 was correct, and since the white bishop has not yet come out to f4, the black knight ac¬ quires an excellent post at e5. 15.. .1Lb4 Retaining the option of kingside castling. 15.. .0-0-0!? would have excluded 16 ^c5? in view of 16...Bxd4, but apart from the quiet 16 fladl it would have allowed the sharp break¬ through 16 d5!? cxd5 17 flacl <4)d7 18 ficdl! *c8 19 <§3b5 Bd7 20 4W+ <A>d8 21 <£>b5. This may not be bad for Black, but it has to be agreed that such running about with the king seems very unpleasant and risky, especially in such an important game. 16 4ic5! This not only ‘looks very strong’, but it is indeed so! However, White would also have retained some initiative with 16 Bad (Osnos) 16.. .£to5 (16...0-0-0? 17 d5; 16...Axb3?I 17 axb3 0-0-0 18 d5!) 17 ±e3 ^ic4 18 d5, or 16 fladl 0-0-0 (after Korchnoi’s move 16..JSd8 again 17 4k5! is good) 17 g4, and if 17..JShe8, then 18 d5! 75 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 16.. .0-0-0! The most sensible: both developing, and defending the pawn, 16...Hd8 17 e5! or 16.. JLxc5 17 dxc5 4tibd7 18 Jld6 (Korchnoi) was less good. 17£ixe6f ‘Played without hesitation. I envy peopkj who stride through life without a shadow of doubt about where they are going.’ (Korchnoi). Although in the given instance there was no particular choice: 17 Hadl Bxd4! or 17 a3 JLxc5 18 dxc5 could not have satisfied White. 17.. .fxe6 In Korchnoi’s opinion, Black now has some advantage©: his trumps are threats along the newly-opened f-file and weaknesses in the opponent’s position (in particular, the g3-pawn). However, Black also has some ob¬ vious weaknesses — the pawns at e6, g6 and g7. White has not only the better pawn struc¬ ture, but also the two bishops, and the light- squared bishop may come into play with great effect. True, because of his insecure king he has to play very carefully, and Larsen fails to cope with this problem. 18 a3?! An error that was not noticed by anyone. 18 ^e2! was much stronger, and if 18...Bhf8, then 19 h4 with a clear advantage: 19...^h5 20 Ah3, or 19...£k4 20 b3 £id2 21 e5 £>d5 (21...4tih5 22 <4^3) 22 Had! It is better to play 18.. .4.h5, in order after 19 Hadl to fight for a draw by 19...^xf4 (not 19...Hhf8 20 Jlf3, or 19.. .^c4 20 JLcl e5 21 b3!) 20 £kf4 lhe8 21 h4 Hxd4!? 22 Hxd4 ±c5 23 Hhdl e5 24 JLh3+ <4^8 25 ^e6 Jtxd4+ 26 4tixd4 exd4 27 Hxd4 c5 28 Sd6 fixe4 29 Hxg6 He7. But here too White’s chances are better; with play on both flanks, the bishop dominates the knight (Fischer would probably have played on in this endgame down to the bare kings!). 18.. .Jte7 19 Hadl Shf8 19...£>c4?! 20 Acl e5 is inaccurate in view of 21 d5 Shf8 22 r<fee2 <Slh5 23 Id3, and White’s position is better: Black has no possi¬ bility of developing an initiative. But now ...g6-g5 is threatened. The critical moment of the game has been reached. 20 4?e2? An imperceptible, but serious mistake, which loses a very important tempo, fln the event of 20 Jtf3 the variation 20..21 JLcl Hxd4 or 21. ..e5 would have gained in strength.’ (Korchnoi). 21 b3 ^xa3 22 d5! is more energetic, when the activity of White’s bishops compensates for the loss of the pawn. But the immediate 20 h4! was undoubtedly the most correct, for example: 20...^h5 21 Jth3 ^xf4 22 gxf4 Sxf4+ 23 4?g3! (defending the h4-pawn) 23...fldf8 24 Jtxe6+ 4?c7 25 Hd3, and the position is one of dynamic bal¬ ance. 20.. .^c4! A powerful %mschen%ug, setting White great problems. Perhaps Larsen had been expecting 20.. .^h5 21 jfc£31 ^xf4+ 22 gxf4 Hxf4 23 JLg4 with a roughly equal game: 23...<4d7 24 d5 Hdf8 25 (4)d3 etc. 21 h4?! ‘An excellent counterattacking resource! This move, intending JLh3 with an attack on the black king, was not one that I had ex¬ pected.’ (Korchnoi). But that which was the strongest just a move ago now causes White nothing but problems. However, he had a difficult choice: 21 JLcl?! ^h5 22 Hd3 c5! (Zaitsev) 23 dxc5 (23 d5? £>e5) 23...Axc5, or 23 b3 cxd4 24 bxc4 dxc3, attacking on the 76 Viktor the Terrible dark squares. One also does not want to give up a pawn by 21 b3 ^xa3, but objectively this was the best chance. 21. ..£>h5! Pretty and unexpected. Black begins a counterattack, in the first instance getting rid of the dangerous bishop at f4. 21...£\xb2!? suggests itself. Korchnoi did not like 22 flbl ±xa3 23 ±h3 lxd4 (23...flfe8 24 d5) 24 Jtxe6+ £kl7 {? - G.K) 25 ±e5 c5 - G.K) 26 jtxd4 cxd4 27 ^b5 and wins, but Black could have defended by 25...flf2+! 26 i?xf2 <53d3+ 27 <i?e3 ^3xe5 and, moreover, a move earlier he could have retained a clear advan¬ tage - 24...^d8! 25 ±e5 Hb4 26 ±d6 He8! etc. Korchnoi’s choice testifies to the evolution of his style: whereas earlier he preferred to 'suffer’ for a pawn, now he did not miss an opportunity to seize the initiative, and with the help of an exchange sacrifice. 22 Ah3 2xf4! A brilliant reply! 23 Jtxe6+? The abrupt change of scene unsetdes Lar¬ sen. 'This move was made from a feeling of contradiction, which is well developed in many grandmasters. It is, so to speak: “I will not allow you, my dear opponent, to lead me along the path of your variation — I have my own path!” ’ (Korchnoi) Of course, it was essential to play 23 gxf4 <£>xf4+ 24 rA>f3 £>xh3! (24...af8 25 4>g3! is weaker) 25 Uxh3 <§3xb2. This, the best way for Black, was found by Korchnoi only many years later! There can follow: 1) 26 Hd2? £>c4 27 Hdl ±xa3! (Korchnoi’s recommendation 27...e5 is unclear on account of 28 d5!, but not 28 dxe5?! Jtxa3) with the decisive threat of... Jtb2, while if 28 4^e2, then 28.. .e5! is now winning; 2) 26 Hgl! e5! (Korchnoi suggests 26.. .flxd4 27 Hxg6 JLfiS 28 e5?l Axe5 29 ^e4 fld3+ 30 <45g4 Hxh3 31 (4)xh3 <SM3 32 Hg5 b6 and wins, but 28 ^e2! and h4-h5-h6 is stronger, for example: 28...fla4 29 ^f4 flxa3+ 30 <45g4 Ha4 31 h5! with counterplay), and it is hard for White to gain a draw after both 27 dxe5 £3d3 28 £k2 (28 a4 Hf8+!) 28...£>xe5+ 29 *g2 ±f6 30 (30 *£2 c5 31 £>f4 Hd2+!) 30...fld4 31 *hl flxe4 32 £ixg6 c5, and 27 d5 4M3 28 Hal (28 Hxg6?

However, here extreme accuracy and re¬ sourcefulness would have been demanded of Black, whereas after the move in the game he has an enduring initiative with material equal, and White is forced to conduct an altogether unpromising defence. 23.. .6.7 24 ±xc4 ^xg3+ 25 &e3 2df8!? 25...<§3xhl 26 <4)xf4 4}f2 27 fid2 jtxh4 28 A* £3 fl£8+ 29 (4)g2 Sf4 would have led to a technical endgame with an extra pawn for Black, but Korchnoi was playing for an attack — and I think that for Larsen this was more unpleasant! Usually opposite-coloured bishops help to save a game, but here, despite the lim¬ ited material, Korchnoi succeeds in using this factor to create threats to the king. 26 2hg1 If 26 ffh2, apart from the obvious 26.. .Jlxh4, 26...g5!? 27 hxg5 (27 h5 g4!) 27.. .±xg5 28 4>d3 b5 29 ±e6 Hf3+ 30 4>c2 4ifl is also strong. 26..

The win for him is only a matter of time and technique, something in which Korchnoi is not lacking. 38 Bel 39 Be8 ^d4+ 40 4>d2 Ag5+ ‘A weak move. The bishop was best placed at f6.

Essentially it was this game that dashed Larsen’s hopes of again reaching the Candi¬ dates: the painful defeat had a depressing ef¬ fect on him. In the second half of the tourna¬ ment he was quite unrecognisable and, after suffering a further four defeats, he dropped out of contention for the prize places. As for Korchnoi, in the 9th round he de¬ feated another dangerous rival — Robert Byrne (who had 6V2 out of 8 at that point) and con¬ tinued his confident progress. Incidentally, in the game with Byrne he employed the same rare plan against the King’s Indian Defence that Taimanov had played in his match with Fischer, but with far greater success (cf. Game No.39, note to White’s 9th move). Korchnoi annotated this game in such detail that 22 years later he merely added: ‘Good comments. I would advise every young master to work on his won (and also lost!) games as much as I had to work here.’ 78 Viktor the Terrible But in the 13th round he unexpectedly lost to Rukavina and was caught by Karpov, who played the entire tournament very evenly and strongly. They also finished level, after each scoring a further 3V2 out of 4(!), and in total — 13V2 out of 17, a point ahead of Byrne, who undoubtedly played the ‘tournament of his life’. However, Korchnoi too rates this Inter- 2onal, like the tournaments in Wijk aan Zee and Mallorca (1968) among the best achieve¬ ments in his career. The favourites in the 1974 Candidates se¬ ries were considered to be the ex-world champions Spassky and Petrosian. However, Korchnoi and Karpov overturned all the fore¬ casts: the former defeated Mecking (+3—1=9) and Petrosian (+3—1=1), who resigned ahead of schedule, and the latter — Polugayevsky and Spassky. Details of these two encounters and the Karpov-Korchnoi final Candidates match will be found in the chapter on the 12th world champion. It was then that the persecution of Korchnoi, which in the end led to him escap¬ ing from the USSR, began. I should remind you that the Candidates final would determine the opponent of the American Fischer, and the Soviet authorities decided to pin their hopes on Karpov. ‘Our match was perceived as an important political action by all the or¬ ganisations of the Soviet Union/ writes Korchnoi. ‘An action which should have en¬ sured victory for the young challenger — a Russian, a product of the working class, who was faithful and obedient to the authorities. He was given all the best resources, and was also provided with support outside of chess... When the match ended, it only remained to fulfil the second, easier part of the political objective that had been set — to punish me. To make an example of me, as a warning to oth¬ ers. For what? For independence in thinking and behaviour. But more concretely — for the fact that I had fought in this match, when it was already clear to everyone what should hap¬ pen.’ The official ground for punishment was a sharp, angry interview which Korchnoi gave to B.Kazic on the conclusion of the match, which was published in the Yugoslav newspa¬ per Politika. Here is this seditious and, as shown by subsequent chess history, in fact by no means objective, text (with his final con¬ clusion Viktor Lvovich altogether ‘guessed wrongly*): T think that Petrosian, whom I beat in the semi¬ final, is stronger than Karpov. And in general, neither Spassky, nor Polugayevsky, against whom Karpov won, is inferior to him in chess knowledge and talent I think that I too can be compand with these grandmas¬ ters. I put up mon of a resistance than thy did,L Kar¬ pov does not possess an extensive chess arsenal or great chess “assets”. But he is a player of very strong will, with a fantastic striving for victory. With this enor¬ mous willpower he literally squeezed his opponents, including me... When I lost the match to Spassky (1968), I found it difficult But I sensed his strength and I predicted his win over Petrosian. And Spassky did indeed become world champion. But about my last opponent I cannot say that a brilliant future awaits him. * The response of the authorities was severe: ‘for incorrect behaviour* Korchnoi was for¬ bidden by a decree of the Sports Committee to play in any international tournaments for a year and his grandmaster stipend was reduced by one third. A campaign against him was begun in the newspaper Soyyetsky Sporty where his former friend, but now bitterest enemy, Petrosian published a response ‘Regarding an interview by V.Korchnoi* and then indignant letters from readers appeared under the head¬ ing ‘Unsporting, grandmaster!* The year of disgrace, 1975, was certainly the most difficult in Korchnoi’s professional ca¬ reer. In February, ‘under the guise of intensive preparation for Karpov’s match with Fischer, the leading Soviet grandmasters were obliged to present in writing their evaluation of the style and strengths of Fischer’s play, and at the same time, for comparison, also that of Kar¬ pov,’ but Korchnoi refused (a similar letter in 79 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 1972 had been sufficient — c£ the start of the chapter ‘Battle of the Gods' in Volume 4). In March his invitation to an international tour¬ nament in Tallinn was cancelled. But soon Karpov came to his help. ‘He had become world champion without playing the match with Fischer, and it so happened that the pub¬ lic were somehow beginning to forget those he had defeated: his victims, Spassky and Korchnoi, had fallen into disgrace, and hence into obscurity,’ explains Korchnoi. ‘Karpov took steps to bring me back into commission. I was allowed to play in the autumn Alekhine Memorial tournament in Moscow, and then also in Hastings (1975/76).’ It need hardly be said that in the Moscow super-tournament the most important game for Korchnoi was the one with Petrosian. I cannot avoid quoting a few of his remarkable comments, which date from the 21st century (I think that in general he is one of the best annotators in the history of chess). Game 21 V.Korchnoi-T.

On the 30th move Black was forced to give up a rook for a powerful knight at d6. ‘And at the same time, for Petrosian the ex¬ change sacrifice was a recurrent strategic theme — in this way he won a number of games!’ The game was adjourned twice (Korchnoi was helped in his analysis by his compatriot and old friend Spassky) and in total was played over three evenings, with White finding him¬ self in time-trouble three times! In the end, the tired Korchnoi found an unexpected idea at the board on the 66th move. Petrosian imme¬ diately made a mistake and on the 74th move he conceded defeat. Korchnoi’s epilogue: ‘A few years later Yakov Murey wrote to me: “This game was won by three of us — by me in the opening, by you in the middlegame, and by Spassky in the endgame.” This is the truth. I should like to take the opportunity to ex¬ press my gratitude to Boris Spassky for his excellent adjournment analysis.’ It was that autumn, in November, that I first met Karpov and Korchnoi at the chessboard — in the then popular tournament of Pioneers’ 80 Viktor the Terrible Palaces. In each round the grandmaster captain played simultaneously against seven young op¬ ponents, then his result was added to the result of his team, and the winners were those who ultimately gained the greatest number of points. Karpov played for Chelyabinsk, Korchnoi for Leningrad, Smyslov for Moscow, Bagirov for my native Baku, and so on. The Baku team was not very strong, and I, a 12-year-old candidate master, frequently had to effectively play one to one with the grand¬ master, who devoted the main attention to the game with his most dangerous opponent. In the 1st round I lost from an excellent position to Smyslov, in the 2nd I earned a point in a rook ending with Katalymov, and in the 3rd I made a draw from a position of strength with Polugayevsky. In the 4th round, playing against Karpov, I altogether finished up play¬ ing alone — and, alas, I was unable to hold my ground, although I again had an excellent po¬ sition. Then came a draw with Kuzmin. And in the 6th and final round we played Korchnoi, who was engaged in a desperate struggle with Karpov and Smyslov for the best result among the grandmasters, while the Len¬ ingrad team was competing with Moscow for first place in the overall score. The display took an exceptionally tense course: Korchnoi played with enormous drive — he was trying to finish ahead of Karpov at any price. For him this was a crucial matter — to gain at least a minor revenge! I played the King’s Indian Defence and, on encountering the Samisch Variation, I sacrificed a pawn to gain compensation in the form of a powerful dark-squared bishop against a knight. In the endgame Black seized the initiative and Korchnoi had to solve some very difficult problems. Eventually he held out, but at the cost of great effort, and the grandmaster lost an ‘extra’ point on the other boards. Thus it was Smyslov who finished with the best result — 38 out of 42, with Karpov and Korchnoi half a point behind. True, the points gained by Karpov carried more weight: in contrast to his rivals, he played against both of the strongest teams — Moscow and Leningrad... The emo¬ tions of Viktor Lvovich were plain to see. His farewell ‘Soviet finale’ was his victory on board one in the USSR Team Cup (Tbilisi, April 1976) — 5 out of 7, ahead of Karpov (4 out of 6), Petrosian, Tal and Smyslov. In the key match between Tmd and the Central Army Club, it was the reserve Gipslis instead of Karpov who turned out to play Black against Korchnoi — and he was unable to withstand his opponent’s onslaught. Some¬ thing similar, you may recall, occurred at the 1939 Olympiad in Buenos Aires: Alekhine and Capablanca were also competing for the best result on board one, and when the Cuban missed the game with his main rival, the en¬ raged Alekhine cmshed the reserve player... In July 1976 sensational news spread round the chess world: one of the winners of the tournament in Amsterdam, the four-times USSR Champion Viktor Korchnoi, had re¬ quested political asylum in Holland! By his own admission, the decision to leave had been taken at the end of December 1974. And later he repeatedly emphasised the purely profes¬ sional motives for his action. He simply be¬ came aware of ‘the need to leave for the sake of continuing, saving his chess life, which Party officials in alliance with certain grand¬ masters had decided to stifle.’ But, of course, the Soviet authorities judged Korchnoi’s defection to be a political action and assailed him with the entire might of the propaganda machine: a statement by TASS, an extensive resolution by the Chess Federation, an open condemnatory letter by more than thirty Soviet grandmasters (not signed only by Botvinnik, Bronstein, Spassky and Gulko), and a separate condemnatory letter by Kar¬ pov... They were unanimously revolted by ‘Korchnoi’s unworthy behaviour’ and ap¬ proved the verdict of the Federation to ‘de¬ prive him of his sports titles and the right to represent the Soviet Chess School in the world arena.’ 81 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Meanwhile, Korchnoi had represented this school for a good twenty years, and he did this more than worthily: as a member of the USSR team he was the winner of five European Team Championships (+22—3=11) and six World Olympiads (+50—3=31). The last time he played for the Soviet Union, brilliantly as usual, was at the Olympiad in Nice (1974). Of his eight wins I especially like his Trench duel’ with the rising star of European chess Jan Timm an.

As often happens in chess, this duel had an interesting continuation. Soon after his escape to the West, Korchnoi played an entire best of ten games match with Timman, which served as a good warm-up for the 1977 Candidates cycle. The first two games ended in draws, but in the third, where Korchnoi again chose the French Defence, Timman’s misadventures in the match began. 84 Viktor the Terrible Game 23 J.Timman-V.Korchnoi Match, Leeuwarden 1976, 3rd game French Defence Cl9 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ®c3 Ab4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 ±xc3+ 6 bxc3 £>e7 7 a4 ®bc6 8 £}f3 Sa5!

Previously 10.. .®c7 was played (Kurajica-Timman, Skopje 1976), but more often 10...c4 with the idea of 11 h4 f6 (Fischer-Padevsky, Varna Olympiad 1962), or 11 0-0 f6 (Korchnoi also played this), but here Black was afraid of 11 4tig5!?

Now White is denied the knight sortie, but perhaps he can punish his opponent for the weakening of his position? 11 c4 The most natural reply: White opens up the position, trying to exploit the power of his two bishops.

Similar situations, where White cap¬ tured on c5 and tried to gain an advantage in positions with an extra (albeit tripled) pawn and an open centre, occurred back in the Smyslov-Botvinnik matches, and usually Black was able to demonstrate the viability of his position. 16 Ac3 (16 a5 a6!) 16...e5!

It would appear that the young Dutch grandmaster was horror-stricken by this reply: the black king suddenly rushes into batde, with the intention of eliminating the white pawns. But White did not yet have any grounds for panic. 22 Axd4?! The first step towards the abyss: it was hardly right for White to give Black a strong passed pawn. If 22 Sbl or 22 Ab4 there was the unpleasant reply 22...jtf51, but the imme- 86 Viktor the Terrible diate undermining of the opponent’s centre was more energetic — 22 f4! 4xc5 23 fxe5 fxe5 24 Bel (Hartoch) 24...4xc4 25 Bel, and the activity of White’s pieces, especially his two bishops, gives him a perfectly good game. At the most responsible moment, when highly important decisions had to be taken, Timman begins acting uncertainly and in liter¬ ally two moves he loses the battle. 22.. .exd4 23 ±f3+? Probably this is already the decisive mis¬ take. The bishop shouldn’t have been moved from dl: if it could not block the pawn at d3, then at least it should have been kept on the queening square. White should have thrown all his forces into the battle with the d-pawn! 23 Bbl was essential, in order after 23...d3 24 a5 d2 25 f4 4xc5 26 Bxb7 Bhe8 27 Bxa7 Jtf5 to bring up the king by 28 4f2 and, ap¬ parently, escape the worst 23.. .4xc5 24 Jtxb7 if5! A very strong reply: now White cannot de¬ velop his rook via bl and he has no defence against the threatened advance of the d-pawn. His extra pawn is not felt at all — the activity of the black king is far more important. 25 if3 (25 ±d5 Ac2! and ...d4-d3) 25...2he8 26 Ba2 Bb8 (26...d3l?) 27 Bd2 Bbl 27...Bb4 was also good, but Korchnoi has chosen a way to convert his advantage that involves the exchange of a pair of rooks and the bishops. 28 g4 (28 ie2 Beb8) 28...Bee1 29 Bxel fixe 1 4- 30 4g2 Ae4 (technically simpler than 30...ig6) 31 Axe4 2xe4 The fate of the game is decided by the passed d-pawn, supported by the king: the white king, cut off along the e-file, can merely watch as it inexorably advances towards the queerting square. 32 4f3 (Hartoch’s idea 32 £3 is defeated by 32.. .fle3 33 &£2 fla3 and ...Sxa4) 32...2e5 33 h4 (or 33 Sc2(b2) d3! and ...<A’d4) 33.. .*xc4 34 2c2+ *b3 35 2c7 d3 36 Hxh7 2d5 37 2b7+ <4>c2 38 2c7+ *b1 39 Hb7+ *a1 40 2b5 2d8 0-1 Korchnoi also won the 4th game, and in the end also the match ahead of schedule: 5Vz- 2V2. What was impressive was not only the score, but also the character of the play: Korchnoi played more freshly, forcefully and interestingly, and even such a brilliant, inven¬ tive player as Timman was unable to counter this. This confident victory over one of the strongest young players from the West be¬ came the start of the highest ascent in Korchnoi’s chess career. It was in the period from 1976 to 1980 that his brilliant competitive results were combined with an amazing richness of creative ideas, and Korchnoi’s contribution to the development of chess reached its historic peak. And yet he was already nearly 50 years old! This achieve¬ ment largely refuted previous impressions 87 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors about the optimum age for the greatest achievements in chess. Here one cannot help remembering a sen¬ timent from the aforementioned letter by Karpov: ‘V.Korchnoi’s decision to betray his homeland distressed me, because the step taken by him places under threat the entire subsequent creative activity of this chess player/ It is interesting to ask, what exactly was this threat? Perhaps the imminent boycott of the defector in all international tourna¬ ments where Soviet grandmasters were par¬ ticipating? Or perhaps Karpov had in mind the letter from the Soviet Federation to the FIDE Congress, suggesting that Korchnoi should be excluded from the forthcoming Candidates matches? However, the Congress and the 1976 Olympiad took place in Israel, and were boycotted by the Soviet Union and other countries of the communist bloc. ‘In their absence,’ writes Korchnoi, ‘the letter from the USSR Chess Federation was read out, but in view of its absurdity it was not even discussed.’ The chess world held its breath in anticipa¬ tion of the Candidates matches, in which a completely different intrigue had suddenly emerged... draw. In the 8th game the ex-world champion achieved an obvious positional advantage, but in time-trouble he suddenly played 33 e3-e4??, leaving his rook at cl en prise to a bishop at g5. This inexplicable blunder decided the fate of the game, and probably of the match as a whole. Korchnoi won 6 Vi-5 Vi (+2—1—9). The semi-final match with Lev Po- lugayevsky (Evian, summer 1977) turned out quite differently. Korchnoi demonstrated genuinely strong, confident and interesting play — and as a result he literally crushed his opponent. He indicated his match strategy straight away in the first game: employing a very rare continuation, he unexpectedly went into an ending where he was the exchange up, but Polugayevsky had compensation that was more than sufficient to maintain the balance. However, acting with great energy and inven¬ tion, Korchnoi gradually converted his ex¬ change advantage. This game probably suggested to him that complicated, non-standard endgame positions were a weak spot for the opponent and that by going into such endings it was possible to neutralise Polugayevsky’s brilliant opening preparation. In the next game too, events de¬ veloped along similar lines. Rout in Evian In order to reach a match for the world championship, Korchnoi had to overcome a ‘triple barrier’ of his former compatriots. The ‘blocks’ standing in his way were Petrosian, Polugayevsky and Spassky. This is how he recalls his quarter-final match with Tigran Petrosian (II Cioccio, spring 1977): The first test took place in an atmosphere of deep hostility. Our chess strengths were absolutely equal, but my nerves proved stronger.’ The quality of the play in that very difficult match of 12 games was comparatively low, with good ideas alternating with bad mistakes. After four draws Korchnoi won the 5th game, but Petrosian immediately hit back in the 6th. Then there was another Game 24 L. Polugayevsky-V.

In the footsteps of Euwe! It was tradition¬ ally thought that in such quiet variations of the Queen’s Indian Defence White has a minimal plus, that he is not threatened by anything, and that he can play for a win without particu¬ lar risk by gradually intensifying the pressure. But Black’s move shows that he is not intend¬ ing patiendy to fight only for equality and that he wants to seize the initiative on the kingside. 15 #c2! (preparing e2-e4) 15,..£ig6 16 e4 f4 Of course, 16...fxe4P! 17 ®xe4 would suit White fine, since in that case ...g7-g5 would prove to be a serious weakening. 17e5±g7 18#e4 White maintains his pawn centre.

A seemingly natural, but faulty exchange, condemning White to an inferior endgame.

With time-trouble imminent, Polugayevsky apparendy underestimated this capture: the opponent voluntarily doubles his pawns! But Korchnoi subtly sensed the dynamics of the resulting position: Black will most probably be able to seize control of the open e-file (in view of the unfortunate position of the white rook at d3) and his pawn group on the kingside constitutes a great strength. 26 £ig2 g4!? (another surprise: 26...fxg3 27 hxg3 f4 suggests itself, immediately undou¬ bling the pawns) 27 Sixf4 27 f3 came into consideration, but White, short of time, may not have liked 27...h5 28 <4>f2 fxg3+ 29 hxg3 f4. 27...^xf4 28 gxf4 ±h6\ 29 fie2 Axf4 After quickly getting rid of his doubled pawns, on ‘his’ flank Black has obtained a far- advanced pawn majority. White has to play very accurately to hold this ending. 30 2e6? Completely thrown off balance both by Korchnoi’s powerful pressure and by the un¬ anticipated turn of events, Polugayevsky makes what is probably the decisive mistake. 30 fidl was essential, continuing to fight for the e-file, and hence for a draw. 90 Viktor the Terrible 30...5fe8 (now the e-file is under Black’s control) 31 Bf6 Se1+ 32 ^g2 Bf8 (one black rook invades the opponent’s position, while the other eliminates his active rook) 33 Hxf8+ *xf8 34 d5?! Some commentators recommended 34 jta3+, but after 34...^£7 35 d5 fie2 White has nothing better than to go into a lost rook end¬ game: 36 d6 cxd6 37 Jtxd6 Jlxd6 38 Sxd6 flxa2 39 b4 Ba4 40 Sd7+ <4^ etc. 34 itc3 He2 35 a4(a3) was probably more tenacious, but here too after 35...h5 White has no way of opposing the combined onslaught of the black pieces. 34.. Jld6 (34...He2!?) 35 ±c3 2d! 36 ±d2Bc2 37 a4f4 The white pawns on the queenside are ‘fro¬ zen’, whereas on the kingside Black’s pawns advance, at the same time creating, with minimal forces, an attack on the king (a fa¬ vourite endgame stratagem of Korchnoi!). 38 h3 f3+ 39 4>f1 h5 40 hxg4 hxg4 41 4e1 0-1 The sealed move.

In the third game, where soon after the opening White reached a technical endgame with bishop and knight against rook and pawn, Polugayevsky again did not make use of all his chances, whereas with Korchnoi was able to set him insoluble problems enterpris¬ ing play. After this win the score became 3-0 and the outcome of the match was no longer in doubt. But there were still numerous events to come, interesting from the purely chess point of view. Incidentally, the games of this match and even Korchnoi’s name were not published in the general Soviet press, and sometimes we learned the results after a week’s delay (in fact, how could a Soviet player be whitewashed by some villainous defector?!). I remember how on one occasion my trainer Alexander Nikitin, with a conspiratorial smile, invited me ‘to look at three recent games’. He showed them with¬ out making any comments, merely clicking his tongue in admiration after certain moves. And then he asked: What do you think, who were the players?’ Straightforward deduction sug¬ gested to me that these were the first three games from the Korchnoi-Polugayevsky match. But it was hard to imagine that all three had been won by one player! These wins made a great impression on me, in particular in view of Korchnoi’s irrepressible energy and inventiveness, which in the eyes of a 14-year- old candidate master did not tally with his im¬ age of a 45-year-old grandmaster... After a double drawing respite, new trials awaited Polugayevsky. In the 6th game, with an overwhelming lead, Korchnoi ventured an experiment that was very bold for those times. Game 25 L.Polugayevsky-V. Korchnoi Candidates Semi-Final Match, Evian 1977, 6th game _English Defence A40_ 1 d4 e6 2 c4 b61? At that time this was considered to be an ir¬ regular, ‘crooked’ defence, the theory of which was in a rudimentary state. In the 19th century it was occasionally played by English and American players, in the early 1920s — by the 91 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors hypermodernists Breyer, Red and Nimzo- witsch, and in 1975 it was seriously taken up by Tony Miles. His example was followed by Keene, Stean, Speelman, Plaskett, Conquest, Hodgson, King, Short, Adams, Sadler... So that this variation can rightfully be called the English Defence. It was no accident that Korchnoi used one of the bold ideas of Miles, who was distin¬ guished by his original handling of the open¬ ing (on one occasion he succeeded in beating none other than Karpov with Black after 1 e4 a6?! 2 d4 b5). This had an obvious psychologi¬ cal implication: deviating from well-known theoretical paths was especially unpleasant for an opponent exhausted by his preceding suf¬ ferings. 3 e4 The critical occupation of the centre. After the less aggressive 3 <53f3 Jlb7 4 g3 Ab4+ 5 ild2 (Rubinstein-Nimzo witsch, Gothenburg 1920) 5...Axf3l 6 exf3 Axd2+ Black has good counterplay. To 3 d5 Miles used to reply 3...Wh4, but when he lost to Karpov after 4 £k3! Jlb4 5 Ad2 ^f6 6 e3 (Bugojno 1978), he switched to 3.. .^f6. And after 3 a3 he used to choose 3.. .g6 or the old move 3...f5 (Brien-Green, London 1856; Wisker-Bird, 3rd matchgame, London 1873), believing in Black’s resources after 4 d5 5 g3 Jlb7. This belief was shared by Speelman, and Short, and Moro- zevich, who in this way gained draws against me (Frankfurt rapidplay 2000) and Karpov (Cannes 2002). 3...±b7 After this White is at the crossroads. 4 Wc2 A new way of defending the e4-pawn. Be¬ fore this game and afterwards they defended with the pawn, knight or bishop: 1) 4 £3 Ab4+ (4...f5 5 exf5 4^h6!? 6 fxe6 4^f5! 7 4^e2 Ad6 is sharper, Ree-Miles, Wijk aan Zee 1979) 5 Ad2 (5 <SM2?! f5! with the idea of 6 exf5 1Sh4+) 5...Axd2+ (in tourna¬ ments in 1977 Bohm upheld 5...®h4+) 6 Wxd2 £>h6!P 7 £k3 0-0 8 0-0-0 f5 with inter¬ esting play (Korchnoi-Speelman, New York rapidplay 1995); 2) 4 ^c3 Ab4 and now 5 Ad3 £5!

Now White has many tempting continua¬ tions, but which of them promises an advan¬ tage? I can imagine how Polugayevsky must have grown nervous, how long he must have stared at this non-theoretical position, holding his head in his hands... Being an inquisitive researcher, he did not like having to solve new opening problems at the board, and the score in the match in no way disposed him towards taking high-quality intuitive decisions. 5^d2 Avoiding 5 £>c3 ±b4 6 i.d3 (6 d5 J,xc3+!

A waste of a tempo. White’s position would still have been not so bad, had he played 13 flgll, preparing to bring out his rook and evacuate his king. 13...lTh3+! Again an unnerving move.

However, after 23 f3! there is still all to play for. 22 Be7! Wg1+ (not 22...fif7 23 ±xf6 with equality, but 22...Wh6l? was interesting) 23 *e2 #g4+ 24 *e1 h5 25 ®g3! 25.. .Wxg3?! But this is indeed an inaccuracy. In another version of the rook ending — after 25...fif7! (Keene) 26 JLxf6 gxf6 27 Wxg4+ (27 fie4?

After reaching a rook ending a pawn down, Polugayevsky resists with all his might and creates real counterplay. It is hard to say whether Korchnoi could have improved Black’s play during the following series of time-trouble moves (a detailed analysis of this endgame does not come within our remit). 30.. .4g5 31 fia8 *xf5 32 fixa7 d6 33 a4 4e6 34 a5 bxa5 35 Sxa5 35 bxa5 4>d7 36 fia8?!

With their flags about to fall, both players had given up recording the game and, unaware that the control on move 40 had been reached, they continued playing at blitz tempo. As a result White missed the draw which was now very close: 42 fib6! 4?c5 43 fic6+ (Keene) or 42...fib3 43 <4e2 f4 44 4>f2 4>e5 45 fib8 d5 46 b6 4>d6 47 Sf8. 42.. .fib3+? (but Black too misses a win by 42.. .4>c5! 43 fif8 f4 44 fl£5+ d5 45 4>e2 fid4) 43 4f4 *c5 44 fic8+? A blunder. White should have stopped, re¬ covered his breath and made the simple move 44 4?xf5, which after 44...flxb5 45 fla(d)8 or 45 fic8+ leads to a drawn ending with rook against rook and pawn. 44...<4xb5 45 *xf5 He3! Cutting off White’s king along the e-file, af¬ ter which his further resistance is pointless. This situation probably reminded Korchnoi of the ending of his third matchgame with Tim- man, where his d-pawn, supported by the 95 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors king, equally successfully advanced to the queening square {Game No. 23). 46 *f4 Sel 47 Hd8 *c5 48 Ic8+ *d4 49 *f3 d5 50 *f2 2e5 51 Sa8 <4c3 52 Sa3+ *b4 53 Hal d4 54 Icl d3 55 Ic8 d2 56 Sb8+ <S?c3 57 Ic8+ <4>d3 58 2d8+ *c2 59 Sc8+ *d1 0-1 I remember how Vladimir Bagirov, who at that time was Polugayevsky*s second, demon¬ strated the games from this match in the Bu- revestnik Chess Club on his return to Baku and complained of the ‘difficult match fate5 of his protege. I found it very interesting to look as though from one side at the analyses, sto¬ ries and experiences of a person who had been in the very thick of things. To my sur¬ prise, I learned that in fact the struggle had been much tougher than it appeared — espe¬ cially in the second half of the match. Po¬ lugayevsky’s opening preparation was of very high quality, and at times he was able to pose Korchnoi rather serious problems. Bagirov was especially upset by the 7th game, where there occurred a line of the Meran Variation, on the preparation of which he and Polugayevsky had spent much time and effort. Game 26 V.Korchnoi-L.

But after 13 a3 (Keene) or 13 Wc2 it is far harder to do this: the rook move may prove to be a waste of a tempo. 13 Wc2 At that time 13 and 13 e5 were re¬ garded as the main continuations, and this is also the case nowadays, for example: 1) 13 tte2 c5 14 dxc5 4?M7 15 c6! ±xc6 16 Ae3 (16 fidl ^c5!

But this is a serious mistake: such a ‘gain of tempo’ by the attack on the g4-pawn, involv¬ ing the conceding of the c-file, merely plays into White’s hands. 21...1xcl 22 Ixcl Wd7 23 Wf4 Sc8 was better, with equality (Graf- Novikov, 58th USSR Championship, Moscow 1991) or the unclear 21...Se8!P 22 Sxc5 Jtxc5 23 g5!

Po- lugayevsky apparently thought that he would be able to parry White’s threats on the h-file without much difficulty, but it all turns out far worse for him. 25 ®h5! Of course, Korchnoi did not even think of exchanging queens — 25 ®xe7 JLxe7 26 Hcl in pursuit of the d4-pawn, since after 26...Hc8 27 Hxc8+ Jtxc8 28 £>xd4 Jtf6 29 ^c6 Ad7 30 £hta5 Jlxb2 Black’s two bishops compen¬ sate for the pawn. 25. ..g6 Allowing the wThite queen to go to h6, after which Black’s position is probably no longer defensible.

But since they were due to play up to 16 games, the match continued. To Polugayevsky’s credit, even with such a nightmarish score he did not lose heart and continued to fight: he won the 8th game and subsequentiy gained promising positions sev¬ eral times. But, as Bagirov sorrowfully ex¬ plained, ‘all the time he was lacking some¬ thing: Korchnoi was as though bewitched!’ And in the end he won 8V2-4V2 (+5—1=7). This rout was also, of course, the result of Polugayevsky’s psychological instability: he always found it difficult playing against Korchnoi. In many stages of the game he played very, very well, but at decisive mo¬ ments he was not quite able to withstand the tension. And this ‘not quite’ was enough for Korchnoi to score an impressive victory! Most striking were his brilliant form and the sharp leap in his creative potential, incredible for a 45-year-old player. He himself was brief in his assessment of what happened: ‘I was much stronger at the chessboard, my nerves again proved more robust, and the assistance of my seconds was more effective’ (here he was talk¬ ing about Raymond Keene, Michael Stean and Yakov Murey). This match must have served as a warning signal to Karpov and his trainers: Korchnoi had never played with such energy, drive and invention! What was striking was the diversity of the creative methods he employed. But at the same time Korchnoi’s propensity for complicated, non-standard endings revealed itself. His virtuoso handling of them enabled him to cope confidendy with such an expert on opening theory and master of complicated play as Polugayevsky. It was also in endings that Korchnoi was able to set Karpov very serious problems at the finish of the marathon in Baguio... Belgrade Revenge A particular edge to the final Candidates match with Boris Spassky (Belgrade, winter 1977/78) was imparted by the fact that in the mid-1970s the ex-world champion had also been out of favour with the authorities. But then, in the words of Korchnoi, he achieved the seemingly impossible: ‘Virtually the only one out of our millions of emigrants, he ob¬ tained dual citizenship and, while retaining his Soviet passport, he resetded in Paris! For sev¬ eral years Spassky fought for his political in¬ dependence, but “by chance” he received permission to leave exacdy a month after my flight from the USSR.’ Therefore in the eyes of the state officials, in contrast to the ‘renegade’ Korchnoi, Spassky remained a ‘representative of the So¬ viet Chess School’. And they helped the newly-fledged Parisian, trying to protect Kar¬ pov against a new meeting with Korchnoi, and themselves against the threat of the Soviet Union again losing the chess crown. The play of the ‘traitor’ in the match with Polugayevsky caused some alarm. Although at that moment Karpov’s dominating position appeared un¬ shakable, Korchnoi’s rise was just too rapid and unexpected. Suppose that wi thin a year he were to improve still further and be able to fight with Karpov on equal terms? After all, at the finish of their 1974 match, despite his ini¬ tial playing advantage, Karpov had found it hard to dispose of his persistent opponent. And now, when the latter had escaped from the grip of the Sports Committee and had assembled quite a good team of trainers, it was possible that things would be even more diffi¬ cult... I don’t know to what extent all these off- the-board machinations affected Spassky’s play, but the fact remains: despite the help of his long-standing trainer Igor Bondarevsky, the start of this exhausting match (the best of 20 games) was catastrophic for the ex-world champion. In the 1st game he was saved liter¬ ally by a miracle: in his time-trouble haste Korchnoi ‘just in case’ made his 41st move — the only one that threw away the win! But in the 2nd game no miracle occurred. 99 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Korchnoi chose a risky variation of his fa¬ vourite French Defence — as it transpired, he was ready to play this not only against oppo¬ nents inferior to him in class, but also at the very highest level. And Spassky failed to cope with the resulting complicated problems.

In those years they mainly played 13 ^xc3 a6 14 fibl Hc8 (or 14...4ia5, but not 14...0-0-0? 15 #xa6!) 15 h4! (15 ±d2 £k5!

But 13...£rf5!? 14 <S3b5 Wd8 is more accurate, and so nowadays the most unpleasant move for Black is deemed to be 13 'ttxc3! 13...d4!? Again a novelty; moreover, this pawn sacri- 100 Viktor the Terrible fice has become a typical one! Apart from Uhlmann’s old move 13...£\f5, 13...0-0-0 is also in common use, and after 14 lf2 (14 g3 d4!) 14...d4 it leads to a position from the game. 14lf2 This appears to lose a tempo, but Spassky wants to capture on d4 only after Black has castled queenside, in order to attack the a7- pawn. In the event of 14 4ixd4 4^xd4 Black also has active counterplay; 15 lxd4 <Sid5 16 g3 lc6 17 Sgl (17 1x2 ^x£4!) 17...0-0-0, or 15 Wxd4 ^6 16 Wc5 ®c6! 17 0-0-0 (17 Sdl?

(Rytshagov-Djurhuus, Asker 1997) Black can play the ‘Tal-style’ 15...^xe5!? 16 fxe5 lc6 17 Sgl Hg4!, also picking up the e5-pawn and obtaining serious compensation for the piece. 15.. .®xd4 16 Wxd4 b6 As is usual in this variation, a highly non¬ standard situation has arisen. The fact that it is good for Black is indicated even by the sharp variation 16... 1x6!? 17 #xa7 Hd2 18 lb6 ®b8 (Keene) 19 WaS 2xc2 20 1x5 £>d5 21 ld6 b6 22 Wa6+ Wb7 23 Vd3 fid2 etc. However, Korchnoi does not see the sense in immediately launching into unclear complica¬ tions, and he retains enduring positional com¬ pensation for the pawn, thanks to the chronic weakness of the white king. 17 lh4 (if 17 #d3 lc6 18 #xc3, then 18.. 1M5 or 18...Sg4) 17..!b5 18 *e4 Ixfl 18...!c6 came into consideration, and if 19 Wc4 (4>b7 20 Wxc3, then 20..J5g4! with the initiative. 19 Sxfl Keene condemned this move and recom¬ mended 19 Wa8+ Sl?d7! 20 0-0-0+- £id5 21 fixd5+ exd5 22 Wxd5+ sl?c8 23 Wa8+ with perpetual check.

However, the move in the game also does not deserve to be criticised: for the moment White maintains the balance and, moreover, he hopes gradually to repel the attack, hide his king behind his kingside pawns and then, in the endgame, advance his passed h-pawn with decisive effect. But, as was said long ago by 101 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Tarrasch, before the endgame the gods have created the middlegame! And Korchnoi cor- reedy judged that, with the queens on. Black’s threats to the king are quite serious. 19...Sd5! 20 Axe7 (20 ±f6?

Of course, 22 flxc3? would have lost to 22...#h4+, but after 22 g3! it is Black who would have had to seek a worthy reply. Keene recommended 22.. .Hd2 23 2xc3 Sgd8 with an exclamation mark and a ‘=’ evaluation. But after 24 h4 White has a clear advantage (24...flh2?! 25 Hdl!). In my opinion, it is better to play 22.. .Wc5! 23 #e3 (23 <4fl? 2d2) 23...fld4 24 #xc3 flc4 25 #e3 #c6 with a guaranteed draw: 26 #d3 2d4! 27 #xd4 Wxf3 28 Sdl Whl+ 29 4>d2 Wxh2+ 30 4>cl #xg3 etc. 22.. .5d2! Now this invasion, creating threats both to the king, and to the c2-pawn, forces the ex¬ change of one pair of rooks and enables Black to develop a dangerous initiative. 23 Hf2 After 23 g3? #c5 (23...fixh2 24 Sxc3 #d7! 25 2d3 #b5 is also possible) 24 Wb4 (not 24 h4? 2xg3) 24...#d5 25 #d6+ #xd6 26 exd6 Sxh2 White has a very difficult endgame. 23.. .2gd8 24 Wf3 (after 24 Sxd2? both 24.. .5xd2 and 24...cxd2 are strong) 24.. .2xf2+ 25 4xf2 Sd2+ 26 *g3 The king has not in fact acquired a quiet shelter: 26 4T1? is hopeless in view of 26.. .*rc5 27 Sdl (A.Kuzmin) 27...1rc4+ 28 iel Wd4 29 Sxd2 lrxd2+ 30 *fl lrxc2. 26...1^8!

For the mo¬ ment he is unable to consolidate his forces, bring his inactive rook into the game or at least threaten perpetual check with his queen. 33...tth4+ 34 if3 Bd8 The culminating point of this very compli¬ cated and tense game. The issue is decided in a time scramble, literally within the course of two moves. 35 Wg3? By urgently activating his rook with 35 Sfl! (A.Kuzmin), White would nevertheless have held the position, for example: 35...fld2 36 Sf2 WdS 37 <&g3 fixc2! 38 Sxc2 Wd3+ 39 <4)h4 ®h7+ with perpetual check. Nothing better for Black is apparent, and this is not surprising: all the white pieces are in play! 35.. J?e7?! An error in reply, which makes the win very difficult. Although, in such a tense situation, with just minutes left on the clock, it was not easy to find the strongest continuation. Only 35...®h7! would have fully empha¬ sised the drawbacks to 35 Wg3: the c2-pawn is attacked, and after 36 f5 Sd2 so is the Im¬ pawn. After 37 h4 Black has two strong re¬ plies: 37...Hxc2 38 Sdl (38 <A>e3 fid2!) 38.. .Wh6, when with material level he has a powerful attack and a passed pawn, and the more complicated 37...exf5 38 e6+ (i)b7 39 e7 fxg4+ 40 Wxg4 £5 41 %5 1T7 42 <4>g3 We6! (but not 42...Se2 43 Sfl! ®d5 44 Bf2), and in view of the exposed position of his king. White probably has no defence. 36 g5? The fatal mistake. In attempting to create a loophole for his king, Spassky misses the last chance to solve the problem of his rook at al - 36 Bel! (Keene) 36... 1^7+ 37 <4>e3 Sd2 38 Be2 ®d5 39 Wf2. And although after 39.. .Bdl Black would have retained pressure (the annoying rook cannot be driven away: 40 Bel? Sd4 41 Wf3 Wc5 and wins), White would still have had considerable defensive resources. 36.. .5d2 (now Black is winning) 37 ^g4 Wb7 38 Wxc3 (eliminating the dangerous pawn, which is unstoppable after 38 Sgl We4 and ...1rxc2) 38...Sg2+ 39 *h3 Bf2! 40 4>g4 We4 0-1 Decisive loss of material is inevitable. The effect of this win was so strong, that in the next four even-numbered games, where the French Defence was again tested, Spassky avoided 7 Wg4 in favour of the positional variation with 7 ^f3. And only in the 12th game, when his opponent was then leading by a large margin and the fate of the match was almost decided, did he again venture the sharp queen sortie. Spassky’s uncertainty also displayed itself in the 3rd game, where again, as in the 1st and the 5th, there was a discussion in the English Opening with 1 c4 c5 2 4}f3 4^f6 3 ^c3 ^c6 4 d4 cxd4 5 4}xd4 e6 6 g3. In a slightly infe¬ rior position, he suddenly captured a ‘poi¬ soned’ pawn with his queen on the 27th move, allowing a strong counter by his oppo¬ nent. Black lost material and soon capitulated. Perturbed by the undesirable development of events, the Sports Committee leaders de¬ cided that the root of the problem lay in... Bondarevsky’s lack of knowledge of modem theory. Two of the world champion’s agents were present at the match — his chief trainer Semion Furman and the correspondent of Sovetsky Sport and 64 Alexander Roshal, who in the autumn of 2005 disclosed to me for the 103 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors first time what happened during those days in Belgrade: ‘Eleven years earlier Furman had under¬ gone a serious operation, and now the after¬ effects of the terrible illness were returning. Apparently fearful for his health, at some moment he did not want to live in a single room and asked whether I would object if we shared a double room. 4‘Why should there be any problem?” I asked in surprise. And then, after some hesitation, Semion Abramovich anxiously informed me that the Sports Com¬ mittee authorities were pressing him to help Spassky. “What can I do? They’ll make things very difficult for me if I refuse!” Turman very much didn’t want to help anyone against Korchnoi, with whom he had worked a great deal in pre-Karpov times (however, Korchnoi still reckons that Futman had been “spying” on him since 1972). And I said to him: “What are you are afraid of? There’s Karpov!” But the modest Furman felt shy about phoning him. So then I phoned Karpov: for instructions as to what Futman should say to the authorities. And Semion Abramovich replied to the deputy chairman of the Sports Committee, who had arrived in Belgrade: “Karpov forbids it, because I am his second and if I start helping Spassky, I will reveal Karpov’s secrets.” ‘And Furman was promptly left in peace. But this whole episode cost the impression¬ able Semion a lot of nerves and several sleep¬ less nights. He became very unwell and I summoned the embassy doctor, who immedi¬ ately decided: “He should be sent home straight away.” And Furman was taken back. Three months later he died... I am sure that this stress aggravated his illness and hastened his end.’ At the cost of enormous effort Spassky tried to change the match situation, but the next three games — the 4th, 5th and 6th — ended in draws, and the 7th, to his misfortune, became one of the best creative achievements in Korchnoi’s career.

(if 19 £ke2, then 19...fiac8 is now possible) 19...fxe6 20 4^c6! The crux of White’s interesting plan, which harbours numerous dangers for Black: his two bishops soon disappear from the board. 20.. .±xc6 The correct practical decision. After 20.. .Bd7 (20...fidc8? 21 £k4) Korchnoi was intending 21 ^a4 (in ChessBase, Donev parries Stean’s move 21 e4 by 21...Jtg5!), but Black could have given up the b6-pawn: 21...Bc7! 22 ^xb6 Jtxc6 23 bxc6 Ba6 24 <53d7 Baxc6 25 ^xf6+ gxf6 26 Bxc6 ®xc6 with an unclear game (Donev). 26 Bbl! is stronger, with a slight but enduring advantage for White: Black’s activity on the c-file is temporary, 105 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors whereas the weakness of his pawns and the open position of his king are permanent fac¬ tors! Understandably, Spassky did not want to go in for such a position: all the time he would have had to watch out for various threats. 21 bxc6 Jbcc3?! After 21...Wb4?!

As a counter to the dangerous, far-advanced passed c-pawn, Black intends to create his own passed pawn on the d-file and hopes that in the end it will divert the white pieces from the c-file and lead to the mutual elimination of these pawns. It is inter¬ esting to follow how Korchnoi succeeds in avoiding this apparendy obvious and inevita¬ ble development of events. 23.. .e5? Spassky consistendy carries out his plan, not seeing any particular danger in the appear¬ ance of the white pawn at c7. But he would have done better to blockade it in one of two ways: 1) 23...1rc7 24 Wg6 Id6 25 Heel e5 (if 25.. .b5 White has the unpleasant 26 Hc5 b4 27 e4!P) or 24 a4 Hd6 25 ficl e5 26 1fd3(b3) and the c6-pawn continues to restrict Black’s ac¬ tions; 2) 23...Ic7 (Korchnoi) 24 flbl flb8 25 flb5 e5 26 Wb3 flxc6 27 flxc6 Wxc6 28 flxdS 4h8 29 g3 with a slight but enduring advan¬ tage for White in view of the chronic weak¬ ness of the enemy pawns. 24 c7! fld7 25 flcl d4 26 lc6 Wd5 The white passed pawn is already at c7, t Black too does not have far to go: the me ...d4-d3 will be made with gain of tempo, addition, the white king does not as yet h: an escape square, and a further tempo ^ have to be spent on creating one. On the b; of general considerations, Spassky no do thought that he should be able to keep 106 Viktor the Terrible with his opponent in this race. But Korchnoi’s intuitive evaluation proved deeper... 27 WbM (of course, not 27 flxb6?? ISdxc7) 27.. .d3 "If 27...b5, then 28 e4!

It is hard to refrain from such a move — the pawn approaches the queening square with gain of tempo!

And al¬ though, with the queens and four rooks on the board, Black could still have hoped for coun¬ terplay involving the advance of the a-pawn, he would have faced a difficult struggle for a draw.

Black is forced to bring back his rook 107 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors and go into a queen and rook ending, where he inevitably loses material because of the op¬ ponent’s mating threats. Stean recommended 32 Wb8 JSxb8 33 cxb8Hf+ 'Adi? 34 2c8 — to a human.

In the next three games there was a no less fervent, fierce and open battle, affording a great deal of pleasure to the numerous Bel¬ grade spectators. In the 8th game, after errors by his oppo¬ nent in time-trouble, Spassky seized the initia¬ tive in a sharp ending, but during the resump¬ tion, already in the second time scramble, he first lost his advantage, then on the 51st move he suddenly gave up a very important pawn, and as a result suffered a fourth defeat. The score became 6-2 in Korchnoi’s favour. An enormous advantage, which fairly accurately reflected the relative strengths in the match. Just imagine: ‘plus five’ after seven games with Polugayevsky and ‘plus four’ after eight games with Spassky! The Soviet sports au¬ thorities had something to think about: Korchnoi had become extremely dangerous. In the western press they increasingly often began calling him none other than Viktor the Terrible. In the 9th game, which went 1 c4 e6 2 <?}c3 f5 3 ^if3 ^f6 4 b3 b6 5 g3, it was Korchnoi who had the better endgame, and he tor¬ mented his opponent for a long time during the resumption, but Spassky nevertheless held out: a draw on the 71st move. But the 10th game turned into another drama for him: after at last gaining a clear advantage against the French Defence, he almost lost in time- trouble, conceded the initiative, and then liter¬ ally crumbled during the resumption. Starting with the 11th game, miraculous things began to happen. At a moment when 108 Viktor the Terrible everyone thought that the rout was irreversi¬ ble, Spassky suddenly gained a new lease of life — and Korchnoi suffered four successive defeats! A unique instance in his battle for the crown (not counting his tournament failure in rounds 14-17 in Curasao), and in general in the history of matches at that level. His lead was reduced to the minimum: TV2-6V2. Soviet chess fans were perplexed: what was happening with Korchnoi? The papers re¬ ported certain conflicts, and a brief comment in 64 read: ‘After Spassky had won the 11th, 12th and 13th games, Korchnoi categorically demanded that all the remaining games should be played in a closed room, without any spec¬ tators, or that the match should be moved to another country, threatening in the event of refusal to pull out of the match... In accor¬ dance with the rules, the chief arbiter B.Kazic informed Korchnoi that his demand could not be met. To put pressure on the arbiters and the organisers, Korchnoi made a statement that he was refusing to play and was leaving Belgrade. Then he said that he wanted to call a press conference in Zurich, at which he would report on his further intentions. However, after a few hours Korchnoi announced that he would nevertheless continue the match. The next game, the 14th, took place on 2nd Janu¬ ary (since on 30th December play had been postponed because of Korchnoi, this was counted as his second time-out) and ended in a new win for Spassky.5 And it was only years later that Korchnoi revealed in his book A.ntichess what had hap¬ pened then at the match: ‘My helpers and I noticed an increase in the activity of the Sovi¬ ets. First one, and then another Soviet grand¬ master appeared in Belgrade, and Ivonin, the main director of chess and deputy chairman of the USSR Sports Committee, also arrived at the match, and scurrying about in the hall were officials from the Soviet embassy in Bel¬ grade, people with attache cases — their Soviet origin was unquestionable. Some kind of weapon was being employed against me — this was clear to me, but everything around, in¬ cluding Spassky’s behaviour, was mysterious and sombre. During the second half of the match Spassky did not sit at the board on the stage. When he made his way to the board to make a move, he was swaying, with half- closed eyes, like a medium../ Which provoked a protest by Korchnoi. It was affecting his nerves — sitting alone at the board, not seeing his opponent, who in addi¬ tion was playing as though under hypnosis: ‘He did not look normal. Although, of course, during matches for the world championship all sorts of devilry takes place...5 However, Spassky does not see anything reprehensible in this manner of play: ‘This idea occurred to me during my match with Fischer. I was oppressed by remaining in pub¬ lic view for a long time, I lost concentration and found it hard to force myself to focus. It was the same in Belgrade.5 According to the ex-champion, the first five rows were occu¬ pied by ‘Korchnoi's people5 (tor nevertheless Kar¬ pov’s*?! — G.K) and their visual pressure was so strong, that his brain ceased to function dur¬ ing the third hour of play. And Spassky de¬ manded of the organisers a special box on the stage, where he sat both when it was his op¬ ponent to move, and when he was considering his own move. But it was because of this that he and Korchnoi, as the latter expressed it, began the match on amicable terms, but ended it as enemies5 (many years later these passions, naturally, died down, although other dis¬ agreements arose). There can be no doubt that for the Soviet side the match in Belgrade was a kind of testing ground before the main battle with the disagreeable challenger: they studied his habits and his reactions to external irritants — this know-how later came in useful in Ba¬ guio... Fortunately for him and ‘to the surprise of many5, Korchnoi managed to withstand these terrible blows, endure the psychological stress and ‘escape from my fatal dive5. 109 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors He made a couple of draws, and then in a very tense struggle won the 17th and 18th games and worthily concluded this ‘strange’ match: \W2-IV2 (+7—4=7). What resulted was a symbiosis of Korchnoi’s two preceding match battles: both a fierce battle of nerves (as with Petrosian) and a demonstration of his wealth of ideas and eagerness for a struggle (as with Polugayevsky). Thus, more than nine years later Korchnoi gained a convincing revenge against Spassky for his defeat in the final Candidates match of 1968. It is curious that in this same series, only at the quarter-final stage, Portisch also gained revenge on Larsen for 1968 (true, in the semi¬ final he nevertheless lost to Spassky). The rea¬ sons for these revenges, albeit with a certain delay, are fully comparable: both Spassky and Larsen had already passed the peaks of their careers, whereas their opponents, thanks to enormous research work, were still continuing to improve. Whereas in 1968 Spassky was very much on the rise, he skilfully posed the most unpleasant problems and Korchnoi was unable to with¬ stand the tension created by his opponent, in 1977 the roles were reversed. Certainly, the ex¬ world champion still retained enormous prac¬ tical strength, but this was not sufficient to halt Korchnoi, sharply improving in all aspects of the game, who happily went in for any complications, and was ready to play the mid- dlegame, and the endgame, and better and even inferior positions. And so, the 1977 Candidates series con¬ cluded in a triumph for the defector. Korchnoi earned the right to play a second match with Karpov, this time outside the USSR. Baguio through the Eyes of Korchnoi After Fischer’s departure it appeared unlikely that anyone would successfully be able to op¬ pose Karpov in the next match for the world championship: the young champion was im¬ proving literally tournament by tournament. And after all, it is only matches between equal opponents, when there is a fierce clash of dif¬ ferent conceptions and styles, that draw wide¬ spread attention and become landmarks in the development of the game. Fortunately for chess, one of the grandmasters of the older generation — Korchnoi — was able to raise his creative potential and prepare many interest¬ ing ideas for his duel with Karpov, and above all — retain his freshness of thinking and fight¬ ing spirit. Therefore the match in the Filipino resort of Baguio (July-October 1978), which the general public mainly remembers, alas, for its political intrigue and constant sequence of scandals, was hugely successful from the standpoint of chess skill. And I should like to talk about it twice (as in Volume 1 with the Capablanca-Alekhine match): first from the viewpoint of the loser, and then in the eyes of the winner. The main emphasis will be placed on an analysis of the chess content, and of the numerous off-the-board events, which were widely covered in the press, I will only single out those which, in my view, had a significant influence on the competitive course of the match. For this and the next two matches for the world crown, regulations, which were shack¬ ling for the challenger — play to six wins with¬ out counting draws, and a return match in the event of the champion losing — had been adopted with the participation of Karpov at a meeting of the FIDE Central Committee in Caracas (October 1977). ‘Supposedly under pressure, the Soviets agreed that the match for the world championship would be not of 24 games (as previously), but unlimited. But in return they secured for themselves all the re¬ maining privileges!’ writes Korchnoi. His in¬ dignation is understandable: return matches had been abolished back in the early 1960s, and besides, to play an unlimited match and, in the event of winning, an unlimited return match, was in fact an incredible burden for the challenger, who had already gone through a 1 10 Viktor the Terrible difficult qualification process. Also unusual was the choice of venue. Ba¬ guio is 250 kilometres from the Filipino capi¬ tal Manila at a height of 1500 metres above sea level. At times the town disappeared in a thick mist: the match was held in the season of rain, typhoons and storms. Landslides also occurred, and interruptions with the electricity supply... And yet FIDE had also received of¬ fers from European towns! Why was it that Baguio became the venue for a world cham¬ pionship match? The reply to this question must be sought from its organiser — the ex¬ tremely energetic and endlessly cunning Flor- encio Campomanes, who had dreamed of staging the Fischer-Karpov match and was an intermediary in their negotiations (cf. the chapter 'Abdication3 in Volume 4). In Baguio he curried favour with the Soviet officials and Karpov, assisting the champion in every way, although, as the match organiser, he should have remained neutral. Four years later, as a reward, Campo was to receive the decisive votes of the Soviet Bloc countries in the elec¬ tions for the FIDE President.. For a proper understanding of the pre¬ match situation, it must be remembered that Korchnoi’s wife and son were still in the USSR, having been denied an exit visa (later his son was even arrested and imprisoned for two and a half years 'for avoiding army ser¬ vice3). In the spring of 1978 he had appealed to the FIDE President Max Euwe, asking him to help his family to leave, in order to 'secure equal conditions in the match with Karpov’. But here FIDE was powerless. Korchnoi: The members of my family be¬ came hostages, who had to pay for my es¬ cape.’ Before flying to the match he made one more attempt — he published an open letter to Brezhnev with a request that he should 'dis¬ play goodwill’ and allow his family to leave the USSR. In Manila he handed the letter to the Soviet embassy and again read out its text at a press conference. But this was a voice crying in the wilderness: Korchnoi’s family was re¬ leased only after the match in Merano, in the summer of 1982. The challenger’s staff consisted of five per¬ sons, and the champion’s fourteen. 'I was psy¬ chologically prepared for a harsh struggle, but nevertheless the arrival of such a huge de¬ tachment plunged me into depression,’ Korchnoi admitted. Although, the number of purely chess helpers was equal: Korchnoi had Keene, Stean and Murey, whereas Karpov had Balashov, Zaitsev and Tal (only from the 29th game were they joined by Vasyukov). Looking ahead, I should mention that the challenger’s team was inferior to the Soviet team in rating, experience and knowledge, but, thanks to Korchnoi’s incredible energy and his ability to work for many hours at a stretch, it main¬ tained a definite parity in the analysis of ad¬ journed positions (with the exception, per¬ haps, of a couple of instances), and at the fin¬ ish of the marathon it was altogether equal to the occasion. On the opening day of the match, 12th July, the head of the Soviet delegation, Colo¬ nel Viktor Baturinsky, 'on the instructions of the champion’, publicly stated that Karpov was agreeable to shaking hands before a game (this point in the rules, suggested by Korchnoi, also contained this condition: 'if one of the contestants no longer intends to do this, he must inform the arbiter beforehand3) and that he did not object to his opponent using a special chair, but he demanded that it be checked... by X-ray. Which was in fact done — exactly as with Fischer’s chair at the match in Reykjavik (cf. the chapter 'Battle of the Gods’ in Volume 4). At the first meeting of the appeal jury the question was discussed as to whether Korchnoi had the right to play under the Swiss flag. The leader of his delegation, Petra Leeuwerik (later Korchnoi’s wife; at the end of the Second World War she had been ar¬ rested by Soviet security officials in Vienna and had spent ten years in Stalin’s camps), presented a written authorisation by the Swiss Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Chess Federation, but Baturinsky insisted that the challenger could only play under a flag with the inscription ‘stateless5. And he got his way! True, after a protest by Korchnoi a com¬ promise was found: large flags of FIDE, the Philippines and the USSR were arranged on the stage, but on the playing table there were no flags at all. And yet Korchnoi is correct, when he writes: ‘Henceforth, I was deprived not only of a flag, but of legal parity as well.5 The challenger decided to play wearing mir¬ rored glasses, and not at all because of the bright southern sun. ‘The aim was simple: to deprive Karpov of his favourite occupation — standing at the board, stating straight at his opponent. While I was wearing these glasses, all he could admire was his own reflection.5 The first four games of the match ended in draws, although in the 3rd game Korchnoi had a dangerous attack, but he did not find the strongest continuation and lost his advantage. But in the middle of the 2nd game another reason for conflict occurred: Karpov's helpers handed him a drink, which resembled a fruit yoghurt. Korchnoi made a protest: by the FIDE rules any contact between a player and the auditorium was forbidden. Baturinsky made an ironic reply, and on the instigation of the champion's press attache Alexander Roshal the Soviets christened this protest ‘a storm in a yoghurt cup5. But to avoid any sug¬ gestion of prompting, the chief arbiter Lothar Schmid requested that the drink should be handed to Karpov at one and the same time. This strange ‘yoghurt5, which, according to Karpov,- could have one of two shades, ‘de¬ pending on the amount of acidity in the glass5, also disturbed Korchnoi: ‘It was interesting to observe how they surreptitiously carried the drink around for a couple of hours, and then gave it to Karpov, who leaped up from his seat and demolished it. I noticed that after his “yo¬ ghurt*5, Karpov would often start playing with the speed of a machine-gun! It wouldn’t have been a bad thing to take away this “yoghurt55 for chemical analysis...5 Well, when one of the participants in a world championship match is deprived of equal rights and is under constant pressure, any deviation from the norm can un¬ settle him and begin to seem dangerous and suspicious. Later, as we will see, psychological attacks on the part of the Soviet team were highly effective. From the 4th game onwards, when Dr Euwe was no longer in Baguio (the FIDE representative left at the match was Campo- manes!), a place not far from the stage was occupied by a ‘strange creature5 — the subse¬ quently famous Dr Zukhar. ‘He stared hard at me, trying to attract my attention,5 writes Korchnoi. ‘His connection with Karpov was indisputable. He sat without moving for the entire five hours — even a robot would have envied his powers of concentration! — but whenever it was Karpov’s turn to move, he simply froze. You could actually feel the co¬ lossal thought-work going on inside this man!5 Korchnoi demanded that he should be moved, Baturinsky refused, and from then on the battle ‘for5 and ‘against5 Zukhar became the main off-the-board intrigue of the match. In the meantime the 5th game took place. This was undoubtedly the most interesting of those played at the start and is important for understanding the logic of matchplay. Game 29 V.Korchnoi-A.

In the given instance the conflict is as though predetermined: the ‘isolani’ and the two bishops against the powerful outpost at d5 — which will prevail? 16±a2^f4 Here too Averbakh prefers 16...Wd7. ‘After 16...4M5 Black would have to reckon with 17 ^xd5 jtxd5 18 Abl, which all the same would have forced ...g7-g6 sooner or later. The world champion is not in a hurry to com¬ plete his development and he provokes his opponent into advancing his kingside pawns, reckoning that the weakening of White’s posi¬ tion may tell sooner or later.’ (Tal) 17 #d2 ®fg6 18 Jkbl #d7 19 h4!

And although, with the queens on the board, the exposure of the white king looks dangerous, the two bishops suppress Black’s counterplay, attacking his defences from a distance, and the threat of setting up the ®d3 and Abl battery ties the knight to the f8-square. 24...Aa6 25 2fe1 25...2c6 ‘A continuation of the intended plan.

With the move played Black breaks up the enemy pawn chain and opens up the game, obtaining definite counter-chances associated with the exposed position of the white king. Queen and knight, and especially two knights, are a powerful force! However, White also acquires some trumps, such as the e5-square for his bishop. But the main thing is that, in search of a way to save the game, Karpov sharply changes the character of the play, which is especially unpleasant when the oppo¬ nent is in time-trouble. 38 gxf5 exf5 39 Bel Wf6 (before the time control move — a litde trap!) 40 jte5 As was pointed out by many commenta¬ tors, the tempting 40 Se5? f4 41 Sf5 £xg3+ 42 sfegl would have lost to 42...<Sif4! 43 We4 Bxd4 44 Bxf6 fidl+. 40../th4+ 41 ±g3 #f6 42 Bhl! ‘After repeating moves to gain time on the clock.

Even now I find it hard to understand how it happened that neither my seconds, nor the grandmaster journalists, nor I myself saw Karpov’s sealed move. The move was indeed strong, and at the board I had to spend some forty minutes outlining a plan. Soon after the resumption I ended up in severe time-trouble.’ (Korchnoi) ‘As it later transpired, the Korchnoi camp had mainly considered 42...5^e6 and 42...Wg5.’ (Tal). But 42...£ie6? is weak in view of 43 Jle5 ^df4 44 Wxf5 and wins, while 42...frg5 43 ±h4 Wxh5 (43...£kf4 44 Wfl) 44 ®x5 Wxf5 45 j^xf5 (Averbakh) 45..JSe8 46 Jtg3 leads to an endgame that is difficult for Black. 116 43 ±e5 ®g5 44 #xf5 *Td2+ 45 4g3 £M6 46 figl fie8?!

The next eight moves to the time control were made at blitz speed by both players. 49 4h4 ficl 50 #g3 £50 Wg2, exchanging queens, came into consideration/ (Averbakh). This is putting it mildly! With 50 Wg2\ White would have achieved a won endgame: 50...Hfxg2 (regard¬ ing 50../fifg5+P, cf. the note to the next move) Viktor the Terribie 51 fixg2 Hhl+ (51...Hal 52 Hc2!) 52 fih2 £fxe4 53 fxe4 (simpler than 53 Bxhl £}f2! 54 4g3! £khl+ 55 4g2) 53...Hel 54 4g4 Hxe4+ 55 4f3 Hel 56 Hg2 £rf5 57 4f4 Hfl+ 58 4e4 4g8 59 d5 4f7 60 d6 etc. Now, however, neither the queens, nor the rooks are exchanged, and Black retains hopes of saving the game.

(51../ta2 was more tena¬ cious) 52 Wg3?! Tal makes no comment at this point, while Averbakh merely remarks that ‘if 52 Jtxf6 there is the reply 52../S?f4+/ However, after 53 4h3 Wxf6 54 ®g4!

Karpov stumbles literally a step away from a draw: 61...gxh5! 62 Jtxe7 <4>xd4 and ...&c4- b3. Now White succeeds in laying waste to the enemy kingside while retaining one of his pawns on the queenside. 62 4>f4 4hh4 (62...4^xd6? 63 hxg6 £le8 64 d5 and wins) 63 4g4 1 18 Viktor the Terrible 63.. .gxh5+!

The method for gaining a draw in such positions (with an a3-pawn against pawns at a4 and b5) was analysed in detail by grandmaster Averbakh in his end¬ game series first published in 1956. 71 4f5 4a6 72 4e6 4a7 ‘For the moment the black king does not abandon this corner. White would win if he were able to stalemate the king and thereby force the advance of the b-pawn. But he is not able to achieve this.’ (Tal) 73 4d7 4b7 74 ±e7 4a7 75 4c7 4a8 76 ±66 4a7 (76...b5? 77 ±c5 and wins) 77 4c8 4a6 But not 77...4a8? 78 ±bS b5 79 4c7, forc¬ ing 79...b4 80 axb4 a3 81 b5 a2 82 b6 and 83 b7 mate. This winning method, pointed out of Horwitz (1885), was also given by Euwe in Practiscbe Scbaaklessen (1927). But generally speaking, this method of stalemating the king has been known since time immemorial. 78 4b8 b5 The last pawn move. ‘Taking into account the fifty-move rule, there was a sigh of relief in the press centre: the game would conclude not later than the 128th move...’ (Tal) 79 Jtb4 (parrying the threat of 79...b4 80 Jtxb4 4b6 with a draw) 79...4b6 80 4c8 80.. .4c6! ‘Only by moving away from the comer can Black save the game.’ (Averbakh). After 80.. .4a6? 81 4c7 4a7 82 Ac5+ 4a6 83 4c6 4a5 84 Jte3 4a6 85 ±b6 White wins. 81 4d8 4d5 ‘For more than forty moves White tries in vain to shake the well-known verdict of theory — draw! But at the same time Black must act very carefully: his king is constantly on the edge of the danger zone.’ (Tal) 82 4e7 4e5 83 4f7 4d5 84 4f6 4d4 85 4e6 4e4 86 ±18 4d4 87 4d6 4e4 88 ±g7 4f4 89 4e6 4f3 90 4e5 4g4 91 ±f6 4h5 Here the game was adjourned for the sec¬ ond time and concluded only after the next game, the 6th (English Opening, draw on the 23rd move). Some care was still demanded of Karpov, and together with his trainers he no doubt refreshed his memory of the classical analyses, demonstrating that the black king cannot be driven away. 92 4f5 (the sealed move) 92...4h6 93 ±d4 4h7 94 4f6 4h6 95 ±e3+ 4h5 96 4f5 4h4 97 ±62 4g3 98 ±gB 4f3 99 jtf4 4g2 100 ±66 4f3 101 ±h2 4g2 102 ±c7 4f3 103 ±d6 4e3 104 4e5 4f3 105 4d5 4g4 106 4c5 4f5 107 4xb5 4e6 108 4c6 Of course, not 108 ±h2 4d7 109 4xa4 4c6(8) and ...4b7-a8 with a draw. 1 19 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 108...<4f6 A similar ending (with an a3-pawn against a pawn at a4) was analysed by Kling and Hor- witz (1851), Berger (1921) and the Soviet theoretician Rauzer (1928), who introduced the rule of the drawing zone for the black king. And Karpov, following this rule, achieves a draw. 109 Sl?d7 *g7 110 ±e7 *g8 111 <4e6 *g7 112 Jtc5 *g8 113 4f6 *h7 114 sl?f7 *h8 115 Ad4+ *h7 116 ±b2 *h6 117 *g8 *g6 118 ±q7 sl?f5 119 &f7 *g5 120 ±b2 4>h6 121 ±c1+ *h7 122 ±d2 4>h8 123 ±c3+ *h7 124 ±g7 V2-V2 Stalemate! According to eye-witnesses, when the draw was finally recorded, Baturin- sky exchanged kisses with Campomanes in front of everyone! 'At first I checked the accuracy of Karpov’s defence in an ending that was difficult for him/ explains Korchnoi, 'and then, having established that he had learned his “home¬ work” well, I allowed myself the pleasure of stalemating the world champion. Firstly, in this way I did not need to offer him a draw. And secondly, however natural stalemate is in a chess game, to be stalemated is slightly hu¬ miliating. Funny, but it’s true! It is probable that after this Karpov considered himself somewhat insulted/ At any event, Karpov did not stand up to shake hands before the start of the 7th game, and he did this 'with a reproachful smirk5 only after his opponent had sat down. Korchnoi: Within a.moment I also stood up... It is now clear to me that this was a subtly planned overture to the performance before the next game.5 But the 7th, in his view, became the first of numerous extraordinary games in this match. The challenger gained an obvious advantage from the opening, and won the exchange (cf. the note to Black’s 8th move in Game No.76), but roughly from the 27th move the play of both contestants began to be affected by the imminent time scramble. And by something else! ‘Fearing the Soviet psychologist, I played this game from a shelter — I sat mainly not on the stage, but in the rest room in front of a monitor/ writes Korchnoi. 'Only when Kar¬ pov made his move did I unwillingly come to the board, not wishing to repeat Spassky’s behaviour in his match with me. Not being used to this — normally I sit at the board for almost the full five hours — I played far from my best.5 The adjourned position already seemed hopeless for Korchnoi, but together with Murey he found a not altogether easy way to draw. The following day the champion merely looked at his opponent’s obvious sealed move — and immediately offered a draw. Which pro¬ voked new suspicions in the challenger’s camp. Why didn’t Karpov bother to check our home analysis? Is it possible that he knew it before the start of the resumption?!5 Another unpleasant surprise awaited Korchnoi in the 8th game. Before the start of it, as usual, he offered his hand to his oppo¬ nent, but the latter suddenly replied that he would no longer shake hands with him, 'be¬ cause he was behaving indecently’. The aston¬ ished Korchnoi turned to Schmid who was standing alongside: T)o you understand what is happening?5 (according to the rules, Karpov was obliged to warn the arbiter beforehand). The arbiter confusedly muttered that this could have been expected — and started the clocks. Korchnoi was beside himself: What a blatant, perfidious violation of the agreement! The shot hit home: I played like a child.5 In addition there also followed an opening surprise: 1 e4 e5 2 £tf3 3 Jib5 a6 4 ±a4 6 5 0-0 ^xe4 6 d4 b5 7 Ab3 d5 8 dxe5 Jie6 9 £}bd2!? (instead of the cus,- tomary 9 c3 Jtc5 — Game Nos.39 and 79) 9.. .4bc5 10 c3, and after 40 minutes’® thought Korchnoi made the 'secondary5 move 10.. .g6?! The 10th game went 10...d4 11 ^g5!? — Igor Zaitsev’s remarkable novelty (Volume 2, Game No. 118), and Black gained a 120 Viktor the Terrible draw only with difficulty. The reply 10...g6 came as a surprise to Karpov, but he found a strong pawn sacrifice: 11 tte2 Ag7 12 <5id4! £ixe5?! 13 f4 £ic4 14 f5 gxf5 15 5, and Black resigned as early as the 28th move. ‘Karpov conducted the attack quite well. In a first category tournament such a game would have been judged quite highly/ (Korchnoi) However, the champion was unable to build on his success. After two draws the chal¬ lenger levelled the scores in the 11th game, after employing a rare set-up: 1 g3 c5 2 Jtg2 £>c6 3 e4 g6 4 d3 Ag7 5 f4 d6 6 £>f3 7 0-0 0-0 8 c3 etc. On the 26th move Black blundered and on the 51st he resigned. ‘I had a reasonable position, but suddenly an inexplicable decline set in... Yes, days occur when apathy sets in, and then everything seems to go wrong.’ (Karpov) Korchnoi comments: Terhaps Karpov is hinting at the fact that his poor psychologist, after agreeing to be moved back to the 7th row, was unable to help the champion? Or at something else in the same field? The point is that for the 11th game my psychologist V.Berginer arrived, and, unrecognised by any¬ one, he calmly took his place in the 5th row... The opponent did not repeat his mistake again. Breaking the verbal gentlemen’s agree¬ ment, from the next game Zukhar again sat in the 4th row. My psychologist was identified and, usings their vast numerical superiority in the auditorium, they smothered him “with care and attention”. He was no longer able to work effectively. It became clear to me that in this situation Berginer was powerless, and he departed after the 14th game.’ In the 12th game Korchnoi held out in a somewhat inferior endgame. And the 13th game, in his opinion, could have become one of the best of the match, but alas... An ac¬ count of this dramatic game and the following one, the 14th, is given in the chapter on Kar¬ pov {Game Nos. 74 and 75). After gaining two successive wins, the champion finally moved into a commanding lead: 3-1. Korchnoi: Trom that moment the Soviets, aided by Campomanes, introduced a system of police surveillance in the hall. Every spectator had to show a means of identity when buying a ticket. A close watch was kept on any “suspicious” persons. In order that Zukhar should not be distracted, he was always surrounded by his own men.’ Storm clouds hovered over Baguio for the whole of August: the appeal jury was con¬ stantly meeting — there was an exchange of forceful and lengthy statements between the delegations of the warring sides regarding the refusal to shake hands, the role of Dr Zukhar (who is he: a psychologist or a parapsycholo¬ gist?), the ‘anti-Soviet propaganda’ on the part of Frau Leeuwerik, her right to represent Switzerland, and so on. The atmosphere was ultra-heated! During the 15th game Karpov ‘introduced a new type of weapon into the battle’: he be¬ gan rocking his chair. Korchnoi: ‘A conven¬ ient chair: while the opponent is thinking over his move, one can sit there and rock! I walked away from the board, adopted a “Spassky-like pose”, and began studying the position on the demonstration board.’ When Schmid made a comment to Karpov, the latter replied: “This disturbs him, but I am disturbed by his glasses.” Within some fifteen minutes the rocking ceased: the position had become drawish../ A draw was also concluded in the 16th game, where the French Defence oc¬ curred for the first time in the match. The 17th game was a tragic one for Korchnoi. When he arrived, he summoned Campomanes and demanded that Zukhar be moved back to the 7th row. ‘But the jury de¬ cided...’ Campo was about to reply. ‘Move him within ten minutes, or I’ll deal with him my¬ self!’ declared Korchnoi, shaking his fists. ‘Campomanes began fussing about and gath¬ ered the Soviets around him. Karpov arrived. On seeing that that my clock was running, he smirked and went off to his rest room. It was 121 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors nothing to do with him! As if he had not been the one to lose his temper when Schmid tried to expel Zukhar from the hall during the 9th game!’ Soon the challenger’s demand was met Campomanes cleared the front six rows of spectators, and Zukhar ended up in the 7th (incidentally, that day some thirty-odd Soviet tourists were also present at the game). ‘This modest victory did not come easily,’ writes Korchnoi. ‘I wasted a mass of energy and eleven minutes of precious time! Is it possible to play a serious, intense game after expending so much nervous energy? It proved to be dif¬ ficult. Karpov was completely outplayed, but then... Then I began to make blunders, and first I missed an obvious win, and finally, in time-trouble, I contrived to fall into a ridicu¬ lous mate in a drawn position!’ (Game NoJ6). The score became 4-1 in Karpov’s favour, and the outcome of the match seemed de¬ cided. Korchnoi: T was in a terrible state. I claimed my last two time-outs and together with Frau Leeuwerik I went to Manila, to at least relax a little and come to.’ In Manila he gave a press conference, at which he disclosed that the ‘pact of the Soviets with Campo¬ manes’ and also the Soviet ‘chess’ novelty in the person of Zukhar had been prepared ear¬ lier for the match with Fischer. And he de¬ manded that a glass screen should be installed between the players and the spectators, stat¬ ing: The centaur with the head of Zukhar and the body of Karpov must be split in two, oth¬ erwise the match is impossible!’ But Stean and Murey persuaded him to continue the match. Keene and Baturinsky signed a written ‘gentlemen’s’ agreement, ac¬ cording to which Korchnoi gave up his de¬ mand for the installation of a glass screen and his use of mirrored glasses (apparently they ‘impeded Karpov’s vision’), and Karpov agreed that ‘starting from the 18th game and to the end of the match, professor Zukhar would sit in the sector allotted for the official members of the Soviet chess delegation’. The next three fighting games ended in draws, though in the 20th (where Korchnoi first tried the Caro-Kann) a miracle occurred: Karpov achieved an absolutely won position, but he sealed a second-rate move (after half an hour’s thought!) and missed a seemingly cer¬ tain win on the resumption. A new twist in the confrontation began from the 19th game. Korchnoi: ‘I acquired some voluntary, unpaid assistants — two yogis, the Americans Stephen Dwyer and Victoria Shepperd. They only had to enter the hall and seat themselves in the lotus posture, for some¬ thing to happen with Zukhar. He covered his face with a handkerchief, and within a short time he left the hall — for good, until the end of the game.’ Before the 21st game the jury again assembled. ‘Campomanes announced that my yogis, members of the Ananda Marga organisation, had been accused of murdering an Indian diplomat, but released on bail for lack of evidence, and as potential criminals they should not be in the hall. Such was the Soviet viewpoint! Throughout the world the “presumption of innocence” is adopted: until evidence has been gathered to show that a person has committed a crime, he cannot be treated as a criminal. Here it was just the op¬ posite! But it was clear that dangerous crimi¬ nals, real terrorists, would not have been re¬ leased for any money.’ Nevertheless, the jury removed the yogis from the hall, and then from the hotel where Korchnoi was living. He was very angered when he learned that his new helpers, gradu¬ ates from Harvard University — Dada and Didi to give them their Eastern names — had been forced to give a written undertaking not to leave his out of town villa, where they were living. And of course he submitted another protest... In the 21st game there again, as in the 9th, occurred the variation of the Queen’s Gambit with 5 Jlf4, which owes its subsequent popu¬ larity to Korchnoi. In all three games of the match in Baguio, played with this variation. 122 Viktor the Terrible Karpov had to conduct a difficult defence. In the 21st game he tried to solve his problems with the help of an extremely risky, but unex¬ pected counterattack in the opening, involving a sacrifice of material. Such a bluff could well have worked in the pre-computer era, and besides, Karpov firmly held the initiative in the match — his opponent, by his own admis¬ sion, was exhausted. But the challenger conducted the game with staggering composure and later called it his best achievement in the match. It should be said that, apart from Korchnoi himself, this uncommonly complicated and fascinating en¬ counter has been annotated at various times by many well-known writers: Tal, Larsen, Kholmov, Filip, Panno, Pachman, Keene, Timman, Dvoretsky...

Exploiting his slight lead in devel¬ opment, Black tries to build up an attack on the white king caught in the centre. One has to give Karpov his due. It extremely rarely occurs to him to create something new on the chessboard. According to rumours, the rook move to e8 was the brainchild of one of the people from his headquarters — grandmaster Igor Zaitsev,’ Korchnoi comments, not with¬ out venom. The main line is still 10...JLe7 11 e5 (when in 1979, inspired by his opponent’s opening ideas, Karpov employed this variation with White against Spassky, the latter replied 11.. Jtd7?l and failed to equalise) 12 Jtg5 d4 13 4ib3, and here there is a great amount of theory, the basis of which was laid in Baguio: 1) 13...tfd8 14 h6 (14...£\g41? Petro- sian-Filip, Cura9ao Candidates 1962; Portisch- Spassky, Havana Olympiad 1966) 15 Jtxf6 &xf6 16 0-0 Ae6 (16...g61?) 17 £>c5 Wt7 18 4tixe6 ttxe6 19 4^d5 with a slight advantage for White (9th game); Later it transpired that 14...a5! is stronger - 123 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the history of this variation includes the games Farago-Geller (Novi Sad 1979), Korchnoi- Hiibner (6th matchgame, Merano 1980/81), Portisch-Beliavsky (Moscow 1981), Korchnoi- Karpov (11th matchgame, Merano 1981) etc., right up to the simultaneous game A1 term an- Kasparov (Tel Aviv 1998); 2) 13...1Srb6 (a more tedious continuation, after which Black experiences certain technical difficulties) 14 JLxf6 Jtxf6 15 ®d8 16 ±d3 g6 17 exd4 £lxd4 18 <£)xd4 exd4 19 £kf6+ #xf6 20 0-0 ±e6 21 Ifel (21 £4!? Forintos) 21..JSac8 22 b3 flfd8, and in the end Karpov gained a draw (23rd game). 11 £^d2! (with the threat of b2-b4; 11 b4 <53xb4 or 11 <S3e5 d4! is bad for White) 11. ..e5 12 J,g5 ^d4 It is this that comprises Black’s main idea. ‘Having destroyed his base in the centre, he is obliged to continue in sacrificial style. After 12...d4 13 £ib3 lh6 14 £k4 Ab4+ 15 axb4 Wxb4+ 16 thd2 White repulses the attack.’ (Korchnoi). Thus 16...dxe3 17 fxe3 <SM4 does not work in view of 18 exd4 exd4+ 19 4?f2 and wins (Dvoretsky). 13 tfbl 1 The only correct decision! The cowardly 13 ®a4 Hbta4 14 £}xa4 ^3c2+ 15 4?e2 4^d4+! 16 <4 el would have led only to a draw. ‘Since Karpov had played the first 12 moves in half a minute, I had no desire to check the correct¬ ness of the sacrifice, especially since a grand¬ master of my age and with my experience can often determine the suitability of a sacrifice at a glance. The position after 13 exd4 exd4+ 14 the2 £k4 15 Jkh4 JLf5 did not appeal to me, so I did not bother looking any further.’ (Korchnoi) In fact, 14...£ig4! (with the same threat of ...d4-d3 and ...Axf2 mate) is even better: 15 ±h4 d3! 16 Wxd3 £>e5 17 ®xd5 JLf5, and the stalemated white pieces are un¬ able to help their king (18 b4 jtxb4 etc.). 13.. Jtf5 (13...±g4? 14 Axf6 gxf6 15 £)xd5 and wins) 14 Jtd3 e4?! In order to exploit the energy of the rook at e8, Black would like to open the e-file. How¬ ever, he had a more tenacious alternative: 14.. .JLxd3 15 ®xd3 the4 16 thcxe4 dxe4 17 ®xe4 ^b3 18 Wc2 thxd2 19 Bxd2 (19 ttxd2 Wa4! with counterplay for the pawn, but not Tal’s variation 19...@xd2+?! 20 Bxd2 h6 21 jkh4 g5 22 Ag3 f5 on account of 23 Ed5!) 19.. .f6 20 ±xf6! (if 20 Ah4, then 20...±f8(e7) is acceptable — Marin) 20...gxf6 21 b4 @xa3 22 bxc5 @al+ 23 Edl ®a5+ 24 4e2 or 22.. .®xc5 23 0-0 Sad8 24 Hfdl, and in view of the weakened position of his king. Black stands somewhat worse. White faces a difficult problem. One thing is clear: after the immediate 15 Jtxf6? exd3 the rook at e8 begins to operate and Black gains excellent counterplay: 16 Jtxd4 Jtxd4 17 ^3xd5 b5 etc. This means that the bishop must be moved from d3. But where to? 15±c2l? 124 Viktor the Terrible Again Korchnoi gives a remarkable com¬ ment ‘How many times have I been re¬ proached for “pawn-grabbing”, for aiming to capture material at any cost, however terrible the attack that I had to withstand for this ma¬ terial! But here I refrained from 15 Jlfl, which would have given White a material ad¬ vantage, although I did not see a direct refuta¬ tion of it And home analysis after the game showed that White can repulse the attack But what complicated variations!... But it was not in vain that I played for three months with the most practical champion in the history of chess! Even I was able to learn a little about how to economise on time and energy. And I had learned! And in a couple of minutes,* without delving into details, on general grounds I made a practical, Karpovian move/ An important psychological nuance: after the paradoxical ‘Steinitzian’ 15 jtfl! White would have come under an attack, without knowing how deeply all its variations had been analysed at home by his opponent. We will consider two directions: 1) 15...Jtxa3?! 16 Axf6 gxf6 17 iTcl ±b4 18 exd4 e3 (Korchnoi) 19 4i£3!, or 17 cxd5 jtb4 18 exd4, and Black has no real compen¬ sation for the sacrificed piece: if 18...e3 19 ttxf5 Jtxc3 20 bxc3 Wxc3, then 21 ®g4+! 4L8 22 fxe3 (Timman) 22...Sxe3+ 23 Si?f2! or 22.. .1®xe3+ 23 Jte2 with a decisive advantage; 2) 15....23g4 16 cxd5 <2^5 17 exd4! (in Korchnoi’s variation 17 Wcl <2M3+ 18 Jtxd3 exd3 19 b4 Wa6 20 bxc5 Wg6, in my opinion, 21 h4! h6 22 4?fl is strong, while Black has 19.. .1txb4!? 20 axb4 Hfxb4 with sharp play), and White retains the advantage both after 17.. .1txd4 18 A,e3 ±xe3 19 fxe3 ®c5 20 23dxe4 ®xe3+ 21 Jte2 (Timman) or 18 Jte2 23d3+ (18...Axf2+?! 19 <4>fl!) 19 *fl, and after 17...2^f3+ 18 gxf3 ex£3+ 19 <SMe4 flxe4+ 20 ®xe4! or 19..Jtxe4 20 Wcl and Jte3, when he begins the conversion of his extra material. Nevertheless, Korchnoi quickly played 15 Jtc2, having soberly judged that after this move (in contrast to the objectively stronger 15 jtfl) White faced no particular threats, and even if he did not gain a big advantage, the opponent would have to switch from his at¬ tack to the study of inferior positions, where the limit of Black’s dreams would be a draw. 15...^xc2+ 16#xc2 16.. .#a6 A difficult choice. Larsen suggested 16...d4, but this is weak on account of 17 Jtxf6 dxc3 (17...gxf6 18 <2^3 d3 19 Wxd3!, while Tal’s idea 17...dxe3 18 fxe3 JLxe3 is incorrect in view of 19 ^fl!) 18 Wxc3 ®b6 (exchange queens?!) 19 g4! jtxg4 (otherwise 20 JLxg7) 20 flgl, and it is now White who is on the attack. But 16...dxc4 17 Jtxf6 gxf6 (Kholmov) came into consideration, not fearing 18 ^xc4 in view of 18...®a6 19 Wa4 (weaker is 19 £M5?! Hac8 20 fk3 Ae7 or 19 Sd5 #xc4 20 flxf5 fiac8 with the threat of ...JLxa3) 19.. /te6! 20 0-0 (20 ^ia5 ±f8!?) 20...a6 with a good game for Black: the two bishops and various tactical resources compensate for the weakening of his kingside. However, Korchnoi was planning 18 0-0! with the threats of b2-b4 and ^dxe4. Indeed, after 18...Af8 (18...<&>g7? 19 b4!) 19 ^dxe4 We5 20 Id4 Sac8 21 Wd2 White has a clear advantage. In the event of 18...'ffa6 19 23d5 flac8 20 ®xc4 ®e6 21 2^f4 (Korchnoi) 21.. .Wxc4 22 23xc4 fled8! (Dvoretsky) it is not so great, but 20 f3! is better, beginning to 125 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors play for an attack. "With the move in the game Karpov sacri¬ fices a pawn, but prevents the break-up of his kingside pawns. It is possible that the con¬ tinuation chose by him is objectively weaker than 16...dxc4 17 Jtxf6 gxf6, but it should not be forgotten that over the three months I also taught the champion something — to avoid irreparable pawn weaknesses!’ (Korchnoi). With this idea 16...±e7 17 ±xf6 ±xf6 18 4^xd5 Jte5 (Tal) 19 0-0 flac8 is also interest¬ ing, although after 20 Wb3 Wa6 21 £3 ex£3 22 ^x£3 or 21...Jld7 22 Hcl the powerful knight at d5 prevents Black from achieving equality. 17 Jlxf6 ®xf6 18 ^b3! Perhaps Karpov was expecting 18 ^xd5 ItfgS (Tal) 19 0-0 Jtd6! (Dvoretsky), provok¬ ing g2-g3 and obtaining good play for the sac¬ rificed pawn. But White plays more strongly, gaining a tempo by the attack on the bishop at c5. 18...JLd6 19fixd5 Ie5 Forced. 19...Jte5 20 ^d4 Jtxd4 21 Sxd4 Wg5 is pointless in view of 22 0-0! Jth3 23 f4 exG 24 Hxf3, and after 24...Sxe3 25 Wd2! Hel+ 26 <A>f2 #xg2+ 27 <4>xel fie8+ 28 fie4 White wins (Dvoretsky). Korchnoi gives 19...Wg6 20 0-0 Wh6 (20...Jth3? 21 f4) 21 g3, with the summary: ‘Karpov apparently decided that all the same he would be unable to exploit this weakening, and he preferred to exchange the centralised white pieces.’ And indeed, 21...Jtg4? is bad — 22 <?3xe4 Jtf3 23 £3bd2 fi.xe4 24 4^x£3 and wins (Kholmov), while after 21...Hrg6 (21..Jte5 22 f4!) 22 £>d4 ±h3 23 Idl ±f8 24 <SMe2 Jtg4 25 fild4 and £T4 White is a pawn up and he dominates the centre — Black’s e4- pawn is weak and his bishops cannot find em¬ ployment. 20 £d4 fic8 Another very important moment. 21 Ixe5! ‘Faithful to his tactics, Korchnoi avoids a “close-range fight”. Meanwhile, by 21 f4 he could have placed his opponent in a difficult position, since the piece sacrifice 21...exf3? 22 ^xf5 fxg2 23 Sgl is insufficient.’ (Tal). But in fact after 21...flxd5 22 ^xd5 @h4+ 23 ®h5 or 23 g3 ®i3 things are better for Black than in the game. In the words of Korchnoi, White must be careful — after 21 ^xf5 fixd5 22 ^xd5 ®xf5 23 Wb3 ®e5 24 g3 (24 a4!?) 24...b5! 25 Wxb5 Hb8 26 Wdl Wxb2 27 0-0 Wxa3 he would have lost nearly all his advantage.’ But 28 ®g4! would have won the e4-pawn. In addi¬ tion, 22 cxd5! WxfS 23 0-0 is possible, forcing Black to suffer a pawn down either with the queens on — 23...We5 24 g3 (in the event of 24.. .Jtxa3 25 Wb3! Axb2? 26 <£>a4! ±,cl(al) 27 ®xb7 the outcome is again decided by the passed d-pawn), or without the queens — 23.. .#xd5 24 Idl We5 25 g3 Af8 26 ttxe4 Wxe4 27 £>xe4 f5 (27...Sc2 28 Hd8) 28 £>g5 126 Viktor the Terrible ±el 29 £>f3 Aft 30 b4 etc. Even so, in connection with the note to the next move, 21 fixeS! gives White good win¬ ning chances. 21.. .»xe5 22 £xf5?! Dvoretsky’s suggestion was stronger 22 f4! Hff6 (22...WcS 23 £)a4 is no better, while 22.. .ex£3? 23 ^xf5 is simply incorrect) 23 £lxe4 Axe4 (23...#g6 24 £lf&+ Wx£6 25 WxfS) 24 Wxe4 fixc4 25 0-0 with a great ad¬ vantage to White. 22.. .#xf5 23 0-0 ‘Psychologically understandable: I was tired of playing with my king in the centre, and I decided to return the pawn, but to complete my development, hoping subsequently to ex¬ ploit the tactical weaknesses in Black’s posi¬ tion — e4, b7, d6 and the 8th rank,’ writes Korchnoi, mentioning 23 ®xe4? Wxe4 24 4^xe4 fixc4 25 ^c3 Axa3 and offering a choice between: 1) the ‘technical’ 23 Wb3 - but here, in my view, after 23...#c5! 24 0-0 Wxc4 25 Wxb7 Ib8 26 #xa7 Ixb2 27 ®d7 JLffl (27...jtxa3 28 ®e8+ Af8 29 £lxe4 is not so dear) 28 £M5 Ba2 Black has good chances of saving the game; 2) the ‘strong’ 23 ^xe4, and if 23...b5, then 24 0-0 Bxc4 (I think that 24...±f8 25 b3! Axa3 26 Sal is bad for Black) 25 Wd2, ‘re¬ taining a healthy extra pawn’. But, according to Dvoretsky, after 25...Ac7 26 ^g3 We6 27 Bdl g61 ‘the activity of Black’s pieces largely compensates for his slight material deficit’. 25 Hkll!? is more cunning, with the idea of 25.. .Ac7 26 £ig3 We6(e5) 27 t£3. Korchnoi chose perhaps the best and defi- nitdy the most venomous continuation: the opponent is able to regain his pawn and it appears that a draw is now inevitable, but... 23.. .5xc4 24 Sdl Not24lrb3?!lrc8. 24.. .#e5?! Up till now, and then up to the 38th move, Karpov resourcefully sought counter-chances after his risky opening novelty. But this move was generally condemned. Tal recommended 24...Ae7. Indeed, after 25 Bd4 Bxd4 26 exd4 Wg5! (26..Jtf6 27 4lxe4, and 27...Axd4? is not possible on ac¬ count of 28 4^f6+! Kholmov) 27 ^lxe4 Hfd5 it is not easy for White to convert his pawn ad¬ vantage: 28 Wd3 Wa2 or 28 Wa4 Axa3!, while if 28 £}g3 (Korchnoi), then 28...g6 (Dvoret¬ sky) 29 Wc4?\ (29 £le2 is better) 29...1txe4 30 4Ae4 f5 and ...ifZ-eb-dS with a draw. But a move earlier 27 g3! is more methodical, with the idea of 27...e3 (27...f5? 28 #b3+ and #xb7) 28 £4! Wg4 29 We4 and wins (Khol¬ mov), or 27...Af8 28 ^g2! b6 (28...e3 29 Wcl) 29 h4, winning the e-pawn in comfort. Korchnoi considered the best defence to be 24.. .Af8 25 ffd8 (25 Sd4P! is unfavourable: 25.. .5.d4 26 exd4 Wg5 27 £lxe4 *d5 28 #d3 #a2 etc.) 25...g6 26 HTdl 4?g7 27 h3 127 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ‘with some advantage to White’. Alas, 27 Bd4 Hfc8 28 fixe4 does not work on account of 28.. Jtxa3! Therefore, in my view, 26 Hfd2! is more accurate, and if 26...4g7, then 27 fid4!, winning the e4-pawn, while after 26...®e5 27 Ba8 4g7 (27...a6? 28 Wd8) 28 Sxa7 White is again a pawn up, although after 28...Wd6 29 Wxd6 Jtxd6 it is still possible to fight for'a draw. 25 g3 (now Wb3 is threatened) 25...a6 26 #b3 b5 (26...fic7 27 ^xe4 or, according to taste, 27 WdS) 27 a4! It unexpectedly transpires that, because of the weakness of his back rank and the vulner¬ ability of his rook and bishop. Black loses a pawn. He has to chose the lesser evil. 27.. .Bb4! (if 27...fic5, then 28 axb5 axb5 29 #a2! Jtf8 30 ld8 We7 31 #a8 f5 32 lb8 Wd6 33 4g2 and wins) 28 #d5 @xd5 29 Bxd5 Af8 30 axb5 a5! (avoiding 30...axb5 31 Bxb5) 31 Bd8 ‘In this position Bent Larsen suggested 31 b6 Bxb6 32 Bxa5 Bxb2 33 ^3xe4, when he reckons (and justifiably — G.K) that White has good winning chances. As for myself, I believe in the strength of a passed pawn!’ (Korchnoi) 31...2xb2 32 2a8f5 After 32...Hb3 White wins by 33 f5 (33...g6 34 Sxa5 ±c5 35 b6! Jk,xb6 36 fia8+ and Bb8) 34 fixa5 4f7 35 b6 ±d6 (35...4e6 36 £>c7+!) 36 Ba7+ 4e6 37 £>c7+ ±xc7 38 fixc7!

At first sight it would appear that in this endgame Black has more chance of drawing than White of winning. But the chal¬ lenger shows that this is not so. 35 4ba4 Driving the rook off the 2nd rank and en¬ suring the advance of the b-pawn. In Korchnoi’s words, ‘A knight on the edge of the board stands badly — all players, including grandmasters, know this. But White’s primary objective is to prevent an attack on his f2-pawn by the rook from b2 and bishop from el!’ After 35 4£kl5?! White would have had to reckon with both 35..Jtel 36 4fl Bbl! (Dvoretsky), and 35...Jtc5 36 fib8 g5. How¬ ever, in Dvoretsky’s opinion, it would have been very strong to interpose the check 35 Ba7+!, since if 35...4f6, then 36 ^M5+ 4g6 37 b6 jtel 38 b7 is now decisive, while after 35.. :4e6(g6) the move 36 <£la4! achieves far greater effect. 35.. .Bbl + 36 4g2 ±66 37 Ba7+ 4f6 38 b6 ±b8?\ After 38...h5 (Kholmov) White would have won by 39 ^hc3 fib3 40 *$M5+ 4e6 41 <S^f4+! Jtxf4 42 gxf4 g6 43 b7 and 4g3-h4-g5 (Tim- man). ‘38...fib4 was better,’ comments Korchnoi. In this case White could have moved his king across to the queenside — 39 4fl, or resorted to tactics, beginning with 39 ^c3.’ And con¬ cluding with the variation 39...fib3 40 <SM5+ 4e5 41 ^hcl ±xcl 42 bxc7 (here 42 Bxc7 Bxb6 43 Bxg7 is insufficient on account of 43.. .h6) 42...fic3 43 c8W Bxc8 44 fixg7 fih8 with drawing chances (for example, 45 £4+ exf3+ 46 4xfi 4f6 47 fia7 h6 48 fia6+ 4g7 etc.). Possibly, Karpov rejected 38...fib4 because of 39 4fl — he did not want to allow the white king to escape. However, the path to the 128 Viktor the Terrible queenside was a lengthy one, and during this time Black could also have brought up his king and tried to exploit the unfortunate position of the knight at a4. Whereas most probably after 38.. Jtb8 his position is objectively lost 39 Sa8! After Panno’s move 39 flc7!P Dvoretsky advises 39...h5!P 39.. .J»e5?!

The sealed move, which includes the king in the game. The adjourned position is already, of course, technically won for White, although he still has to avoid a number of pitfalls, in¬ volving threats to his b7-pawn (i.e. an attack on the knight at c5 by the bishop and the rook from b5). On the resumption, which took place the following day, Karpov put up a des¬ perate resistance. 43.. .exf3+ 44 4>xf3 4f7 45 fic8 ‘According to my adjournment analysis, the manoeuvre 45 Bd8 4e7 46 fid7+ 4e8 (46...4f6? 47 fid5! ±c7 48 £>a6 fixb7 49 fid7) 47 fid5 Jtb8 48 fixfB would have won a second pawn, but only temporarily.

Jtd6 49 Bh8 4>d7 50 Bxh7+ <4>c6 51 Bg7 White is simply two pawns up) 49 hxg3 Bxb7 50 ^c5 (creating domination with a small army) 50...flbl 51 <4^5 Bel+ 52 ^e4 and the rest is a matter of technique. 2) 46...fxe4+ 47 4?xe4 Jtd6 48 &d5 (forci¬ bly transposing into a theoretical endgame with rook and two pawns against bishop and two pawns) 48...

But after home analysis Korchnoi came to the conclusion that he could manage without having to demonstrate his knowledge of a technical ending (where the win for White is by no means simple and will slip away after the slightest error), and he made a move which does not spoil anything, prepares g3-g4 and gives the opponent an opportunity to de¬ clare his intentions. 46...h5?! A weakening. However, even a more tena¬ cious defence would not have helped, for example: ample: 1) 46...g6 47 g4 flb5 48 gxf5 gxf5 49 <$3d3 3sLd6 50 Sh8 (Dvoretsky), or 47...fxg4+ 48 4xg4! followed by 45 and wins (Larsen); 2) 46...1b5 47 g4 fxg4+ 48 hxg4 ±d6 49 4e4 h6 (49...g6? 50 g5!) 50 4d3 lb4! 51 e4 jte5!

In the 22nd game (again a French Defence) things were heading for a draw, but the chal¬ lenger made a serious mistake in time-trouble and lost a pawn. When the time control was reached, his position was completely hopeless. ‘But, evidently, the “yoghurt” was too nutri¬ tious that day. Karpov continued playing like a wound-up machine (although he could have adjourned the game), made four weak moves in a row, and in the adjourned position the draw was not far off/ writes Korchnoi. In the 23rd game the advantage was on his side, but Karpov ‘not without difficulty found a study¬ like defence’ and gained a draw. But in the 24th game Korchnoi successfully played the Open Variation of the Spanish (cf. Game No.31, note to Black’s 9th move) and for the first time over a long period he gained an advantage with Black, but Karpov ‘again managed to escape with a draw.’ On the other hand, the champion could have won the 25th game, but he blundered in the opponent’s traditional time-trouble and was forced to find a draw in the adjourned position. The draw in the 26th game was not so bloody. Seeing how dispirited and disillusioned his opponent was, Korchnoi used his last strength to try and change the course of the match, but: ‘Desperate play for a win can at any moment turn into failure, and in the 27th game (in my opinion, one of the weakest in the match) this finally happened.’ I should mention Korchnoi’s important novelty in what was considered a harmless variation of the English Opening — 1 c4 e5 2 £>c3 £tf6 3 £tf3 £>c6 4 g3 Ab4 5 £kJ5 £ixd5 6 cxd5 ®d4 7 ®xd4 exd4 8 #c2! with the better position for White, But Karpov managed to equalise and then when, in pursuit of the mirage of an advantage, his op¬ ponent made a series of inaccuracies, he seized the initiative and won. The score become 5-2, and Karpov only had to win one more game. But here the match entered its most intriguing phase. ‘The Gods on Mount Olympus have abandoned their child and drawn attention to an outcast... Karpov’s play wasn’t working, something had broken down in his splendid chess motor. The almost classical style of the artist not only lost its usual brilliance — it simply became de¬ formed under the weight of that pressure ex¬ erted on it by the “collective”: the refined technique became blunt, and the computer¬ like forecasting was replaced by yawning gaps. The masses began to devour the creator.’ (from an article by Emmanuel Sztein, Korchnoi’s future press attache). In the 28th game the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez again passed its endurance test. The revival of this variation in the 1980s- 1990s is largely associated with the name of Korchnoi, who upheld it both in Baguio, and three years later in Merano. And although in the 14th and 18th games of the match in Mer¬ ano White was able to gain important wins (Game Nos. 83 and 86), Korchnoi’s ideas did not lose their topicality, and some of his sug¬ gestions are still the main lines today.

But is there anything better?

After 21 Wc2 0-0! 22 ±xh7+ *h8 23 g4 ±g6! 24 Jtxg6 fxg6 this is so. But, as games from the end of the century showed, after 21 g4 JLg6 22 flcl White has somewhat the better chances. Therefore also after 19 £}bd4! (the only way to fight for an advantage) they began playing 19...c6. 19.. .C6 Thus White has not succeeded in gaining firm control of the c5-square and Black has solved his opening problems. Moreover, he can now think about gradually seizing the stra¬ tegic initiative. Korchnoi’s plan has fully justi¬ fied itself! 20 b4 A quite reasonable move, although, accord¬ ing to Flohr, it denies Write the possibility of play on the queenside and weakens the c4- square, which will be important in the end¬ game (the threat of ...d5-d4). ‘Karpov did not evaluate his position very optimistically,’ ex¬ plained Tal. ‘Meanwhile, the simple 20 Vc2 would have allowed him to play on without any risk.’ 20...^g5 (in order, after the exchange of a pair of minor pieces, to remain with a knight against a bishop) 21 #e2 g6 22 Ag4?! One doesn’t like to attach a question mark here, but objectively this is a mistake. ‘The champion apparently “believed” his opponent. After the retreat of the bishop to d3 or c2 he would have retained an excellent position. Black’s pawn majority on the queenside is static — the advance of any of the pawns automatically activates the bishop.’ (Tal).

White has got rid of his weakness at c3, but now the ad¬ vance of Black’s queen side pawns will be ex¬ tremely dangerous for him. 42.. .C5!? The sealed move. ‘Throughout the match the challenger had been avoiding making over¬ committing continuations. On this occasion circumstances forced him to do this. There would appear to be an elementary win by 42.. .1.2+ 43 Bld2 (43 l3d2? Bxd4) 43.. .fixd2+ 44 Bxd2 (A)e6 45 4^3 c5, but after 46 f4! Bxd4 47 Bxd4 cxd4-f 48 (A)e4!

And Flohr in the magazine Shakhmaty v SSSR altogether buried the challenger, stating that ‘in the event of 46 dxc5 (? — G.K.) 46..JSxd2 47 <4>xd2 <4>xe5 (?? - G.K) 48 *c3 sfrdS 49 4B4 4c6 50 g5!

This suggests the idea that after 46 f4 the immediate 46...b4! is stronger, since 47 dxc5? Sxd2 48 4xd2 is bad on account of 48...4d5! (see above). The rook endgame after 47 4e4 f5+! 48 exf6 4xf6 49 d5 b3 50 axb3 axb3 51 Bb2 Bb8 is also difficult for White, for exam¬ ple: 52 4d3 Hb4 53 4c3 (53 6 g5) 53...1xf4 54 Sxb3 4e5, or 52 g5+ 4e7 53 4e5 4d7! 54 f5 (54 Sbl le8+! 55 4f6 c4) 54...gxf5 55 g6 Be8+ 56 4x6 c4 57 g7 4d6 58 4f6 Ig8 and wins. Taking into account the enormous fatigue after the sharp time scramble and five hours of tense play (as well as the two and a half months of match stress), it was impossible to calculate accurately all the variations at the board. And Korchnoi preferred another move, which also sets White unpleasant problems. This decision was not an easy one, and he made it only after lengthy and agonising hesitation. This is not surprising: a step away from defeat in the match, to allow the opponent to create a pair of mobile pawns in the centre! After writing down his move, he twice removed his score-sheet from the envelope in which it was to be sealed. As a result, for the next 14 moves on the re¬ sumption he had only 22 minutes left. How¬ ever, this proved sufficient for victory... 43 d5 After 43 dxc5 2xd3 44 fixd3 Sb2+ 45 4e3 Hxa2 Black has an easily won rook endgame: 46 c6 flc2 47 2d5 Sxc6 48 Bxb5 Ba6 49 Bb2 a3 50 fla2 g5. ‘43 4e3 c4 is unpromising for White/ (Tal). Therefore Karpov tries to create a counterattack, even at the cost of a pawn. ‘When I set off to the resumption, I was sure that with accurate play Karpov would be able to save the game. But in my time-trouble he continued playing at blitz speed and twice missed a certain draw/ wrote Korchnoi in his book Antichess. However, after thorough analysis neither Karpov in Baguio, nor I more than quarter of a century later, have been able to find this ‘certain draw’ for White! 43...Hb2+ 44 4g3 44 B3d2 probably did not appeal to Kar¬ pov on account of 44...a3! 45 4e3 b4 46 f4 c4, and Black’s pawns are far more dangerous than White’s: 47 6 gx6 48 gx6 Bxd2 49 Bxd2 b3 50 f6+ 4e8 (the counterplay in the centre has clearly proved ineffective) 51 4d4 b2 52 fldl c3 53 4xc3 Bxd5 and wins. How¬ ever, in the game too White’s counterplay is too late. 44.. .Hxa2 (the most forceful, although 44.. .g5 is also good, not allowing the opponent to create a mobile pawn chain) 45 J2e3 cIt was this possibility that White was counting on, when sacrificing the pawn. Now lines are opened for the rook.

This was the champion’s only loss in Ba¬ guio with the white pieces. ‘Korchnoi played this game with great fervour,’ commented Tal, while Baturinsky admitted: ‘Karpov’s loss in the 28th game was to some extent natural; it was Korchnoi’s best game of the match.’ As though the 21st had not oc¬ curred... In the words of Karpov, he succeeded in tuning himself up for the next game, ‘but unforeseen circumstances spoiled my fighting mood and forced me to “overheat” for too long in anticipation of the next clash.’ An hour before the start of play, the organisers announced a technical postponement (on account of problems with the electricity sup¬ ply), and two days later a last time-out was claimed by Korchnoi, ‘who had allegedly got sun-burnt while bathing in the ocean’, and who then recovered with the help of'the yogis. For a month, without leaving the villa, ‘they worked selflessly, strengthening his physical condition and fighting spirit.’ Korchnoi was very happy with the yogis: ‘With their appearance Zukhar began to wither literally before my eyes!’ As a result the 29th game was played only after an interval of a week. Its opening was not altogether usual: 1 c4 £vf6 2 5ic3 e6 3 e4!?

He spent more than an hour on his first nine moves, but he was still unable to find a way to equalise,’ writes Korchnoi. ‘During the resumption, again in my time- trouble, he deviated from the correct course and lost.’ 136 Viktor the Terrible Game 32 V.Korchnoi-A.Karpov World Championship Match, Baguio 1978, 29th game 47.. .£d6?!

In the 30th game Karpov played 1 c4 and after protracted manoeuvring an equal rook ending was reached. The game was adjourned, but not resumed: the contestants agreed a draw through the arbiter intermediary. Korchnoi: ‘Oh, what went on in those days in the Soviet camp! High-ranking officials — Ivonin (the state boss of Soviet chess), the cosmonaut Sevastyanov (the, so to speak, so¬ cial boss — the Chairman of the Federation) had already been for a long time in Baguio, impatiently awaiting the concluding banquet. But there was still no banquet!../ And then came the day of the memorable, long-suffering 31st game. The opening of it did not herald any play on a grand scale. After 1 c4 Karpov did not want to allow a repeti¬ tion of the 29th game, and for the first time he replied 1 ...e6 2 4ic3 d5, while Korchnoi, for the first time in the entire history of meetings with his young opponent, employed the quiet Carlsbad Variation: 3 d4 £if6 4 cxd5 exd5 5 AgS Ael 6 e3 0-0 7 Ad3 fobdl 8 £tf3 Be8 9 #c2 c6 10 0-0 £tf8 11 Ax16 Ax16 12 b4 Ag4 13 £d2 2c8 14 Ai5 J,xf5 15 tbcf5 #d7 16 ®xd7 £xd7 17 a4 Ael 18 Bfbl £tf6 19 a5!? (in words of Tal, it was this ‘questionable move which in the end brought White success’) 19...a5 20 £}a4 etc. Yes, Korchnoi abandoned the traditional minority attack b2-b4-b5, rightly assuming that Black would parry it by ...c6-c5. Instead of this he chose a rare, unusual plan — he fixed the queenside pawns, gaining a powerful out¬ post at c5 for his knight and the possibility of preparing a breakthrough in the centre by e3- e4. A similar plan occurred in the game Andersson-Kasparov (2nd matchgame, Bel¬ grade 1985), except that there the queens were still on the board and e3-e4 led to double- edged play. But in the endgame the white king can go to d3, whereas Black’s does not have such a good post in the centre — and in the end this factor proves virtually decisive! Korchnoi made the correct psychological reckoning that unhurried manoeuvring with the impending strategic threat of e3-e4 would be the most unpleasant for his opponent. Of course, Karpov wanted somehow to open up the position and achieve greater clarity, but he was obliged to wait... Korchnoi played e3-e4 only after the time control, on the 41st move! And Karpov, who had an enormous reserve of time, did not want to adjourn the game in an undetermined position, and he decided to try his luck: 1 replied within literally a few seconds. He made his 42nd move, and I im¬ mediately replied../ As a result, exchanges took place, and by the time that the game was adjourned a difficult rook ending for Black had been reached. Game 33 V.Korchnoi-A.Karpov World Championship Match, ^^Bagui^978^1s^am^^ 47 f5! ‘The pawn duo at c5 and f5 greatly restricts the mobility of the black king. Here the game was adjourned and Karpov, taking the remain¬ ing time on his clock, sealed his next move. 738 Viktor the Terrible Analysis showed that Black's position was very dangerous. On the resumption (not for the first time) the unforeseen occurred. Ini¬ tially the challenger missed a number of strongest continuations, but at the moment when the draw was close at hand, the cham¬ pion made a serious error.’ (TaT) 47...gxf5 48 gxf5 Now Black all the time has to reckon with the possible breakthroughs a5-a6 and d4-d5. But is White’s advantage sufficient for a win? In his very interesting and high-quality book Practical Rook Endings (Olms 1999) Korchnoi devoted 21 pages to an analysis of this excep¬ tionally complicated ending! And in the end he came to the conclusion that Black could nevertheless have defended. But I will venture to assert that his position is already lost (although, who knows, perhaps this verdict will also be disputed?). In my view, in certain supposedly drawn lines given by Korchnoi, White can gain a de¬ cisive advantage with subtle and unexpected play. For a start it is important to understand, and Korchnoi explains this well in his book, why in general White is playing for a win. In particular this is due to the difference in the placement of the kings: White’s can become very active (both after the pawn sacrifice d4- d5 and <id4, and after the manoeuvre to b4 followed by d4-d5 or a5-a6 and ^PaS), whereas Black’s is cramped by the f5- and c5-pawns, and the first check on the 7th rank will force it to retreat to the 8th. The sum of these posi¬ tional factors allows White to go in for mate¬ rial sacrifices, since in some variations even one passed pawn suffices for a win: in view of the remoteness of Black’s king, he is forced to give up his rook for it, and his counterplay is usually too late... Now let us see how events developed in this truly historic ending. 48...Sg8 ^...HaS was passive — after 49 Sa2 White would have played his king to b4, threatening the breakthroughs d4-d5 and a5-a6.’ (Tal).

However, let us return to the no less fasci¬ nating position from the game. 49 Ac3?! According to Korchnoi, he made this third- rate move on psychological grounds: it could be assumed that in their home analysis the Karpov team had not devoted sufficient atten¬ tion to it. The 49 d5? breakthrough was premature in view of 49...2.d8! 50 d6 Be8, when the pawn endgame is drawn, and otherwise the black rook goes to e5, attacking the c5- and f5- pawns. But, as all the commentators re¬ marked, two ‘more dangerous moves for Black’ suggested themselves — 49 fia2 and 49 He6: 1) 49 fla2 (with the idea of a5-a6, exchang¬ ing the b7-pawn and attacking the c6-pawn) 49.. .fig3+ 50 Ae4 Sxh3 51 a6 (51 d5 can be met either by Korchnoi’s move 51...b4, or by 51.. .tth4+ 52 Af3 Bd4! 53 dxc6 bxc6 54 a6 Bd8 with a draw) 51...bxa6 52 Bxa6 Slh4+ 53 Ad3 Bh3+ 54 Ad2, and now it is bad to play 54.. .b4? 55 Bxc6 b3 56 Bd6! or 54...h5? 55 fixc6 h4 56 flc7-H (this is more forceful than Korchnoi’s plan 56 fib6 Bf3 57 Bxb5 h3 58 c6 h2 59 fib7+ Ae8 60 Bh7 Ad8 61 lxh2 Bxf5 62 Ad3 etc.) 56...Ae8 57 c6 with a decisive breakthrough (57...If3 58 fif7 Ad8 59 Bxf6 h3 60 d5 h2 61 d6 and wins), but Black is res¬ cued by 54...1h2+! 55 Ac3 Hh3+ 56 Ab4 ld3 57 Uxc6 fixd4+ (Black’s counterplay comes just in time: he is able to activate his king) 58 140 Viktor the Terrible 4xb5 Sd5 59 Bc7+ 4e8 60 4b6 BxfS 61 lb7 Hf2 62 c6 Sb2+ 63 *47 fic2 64 c7 *d7! 65 'A’bS <4’e6 66 flb5 f5 (by giving up one of his pawns.

On the basis of this variation, Korchnoi correctly concluded in his analysis that the move 49 fia2 was insufficient for a win, and he proceeded to an analysis of the following energetic continuation, which had also, with¬ out any doubt, been thoroughly studied in the Karpov camp; 2) 49 fie6! The same plan of creating con¬ nected passed pawns, but without losing time on the capture of the a6-pawn: after a5-a6 and ...bxa6 White captures on c6 immediately, and this tempo, in my view, proves decisive. For example: a) 49...fla8 50 Bd6! 4e7 51 d5 Bxa5 (51...cxd5 52 Bb6 Sxa5 53 Ixb7+ 4d8 54 4d4 is bad for Black) 52 fle6+! 4d7 53 Sxf6 b4 54 4c4 b3! (a very sharp position!) 55 Bf7+ 4c8 56 4xb3 cxd5 (Korchnoi also gives a de¬ tailed analysis of 56.. .Ilxc5 57 d6, winning) 57 f6 Hal (57...Bb5+ 58 4c3 Bxc5+ 59 4d4 Bel 60 Be7 4d8 61 *xd5 b5 62 4e6 and wins) 58 Be7! (58 4c3 is weaker: 58...fifl 59 4d4 Bf5 60 h4 h5 61 Bh7 fixf6 62 4e5 Bg6 and ...b7- b6 with a draw) 58...4d8 59 4c3 Bfl 60 Bxb7 Bxf6 61 4d4 Sf3. Analysis diagram In Korchnoi’s opinion, this is a draw: 62 4xd5 Bxh3 63 4c6 4c8! However, White has the fearfully strong move 62 h4!!, forcing the black rook to take up an unfortunate posi¬ tion: after 62...flf5 he wins by 63 c6! 4c8 64 Bh7 h5 65 4c5 d4+ 66 4b6, if 62...Bh3 he has 63 4e5! (retaining the d5-pawn: it covers the king against checks) 63...d4 64 4d6 4c8 65 lh7 Bc3 66 c6 4b8 67 4d7 d3 68 Bxh6 and Bd6, restraining the d-pawn and advanc¬ ing his own pawns, or 62...Bf4+ 63 4e5! Bg4 64 4d6 Bg6+ 65 4xd5 Bg4 66 h5 Bgl (chas¬ ing after the h5-pawn allows the murderous 4d6) 67 Bh7 and wins; b) 49...Bg3+ (forced) 50 4e4! (50 4d2?! Ba3 51 d5 Sxa5 52 dxc6 bxc6 53 Bxc6 Ba4 54 Bb6 Bf4 with a draw) 50...Bxh3 51 a6! (if 51 d5 Bh4+ 52 4d3 Black is saved by 52.. .fla4 and ...Bxa5) 51...Bh4+ 52 4e3 Bh3+ 53 4f4 bxa6 54 Bxc6, and Black has a choice: bl) 54...Bh4+ 55 4e3 a5 56 Sb6 b4 57 Bb5! (this way, rather than 57 Bb7+ 4e8 58 c6 4d8 59 4d3, since here, instead of 59...a4? 60 d5! flhl 61 &c4 and wins as given by Korchnoi, there is the reply 59...b3! with un¬ clear play) 57...b3 58 flxa5, eliminating one of the black pawns, after which the other is no longer dangerous, and the pair of white pawns quickly decides the outcome: 58.,.4e7 59 Sb5 flh2 60 4e4b2 61 4d5; b2) 54...a5 55 4e4 Bc3 (55...a4 56 Bb6!; 55.. .b4 56 Ba6!) 56 4d5. Another very sharp position with passed pawns for both sides. White’s decisive advantage is that his pawns are supported by his king and can always cre¬ ate threats to the enemy king. If 56...h5, then 57 Bc7+ 4g8 58 4e6! h4 59 4xf6 h3 60 Bg7+, for example: 60...4h8 61 Bg4! 4h7 62 d5! Bxc5 63 d6 Sd5 (Korchnoi) 64 flh4+ 4g8 65 4e6 Bd3 66 d7 h2 (66...Be3+ 67 4d5 Bd3+ 68 Bd4) 67 Bxh2 Be3+ 68 4f6 Bd3 69 Bg2+ 4f8 70 Bg7 Bd6+ 71 4e5 Bdl 72 Ih7, or 60...4f8 61 d5! Ixc5 62 Ba7 (White has given up his c-pawn, but his d- and f-pawns are sufficient) 62...Bc8 (62...4e8 63 4e6) 63 flh7 4g8 64 Bxh3 Bd8 (Korchnoi) 65 Sd3 141 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors *f8 66 d6 <&e8 67 *e6, and Black’s queen- side pawns have not even managed to ad¬ vance. 56...b4 is stronger, with the idea of 57 Ha6? h5 58 Hxa5 b3 (diverting White’s attention with the help of the a- and b-pawns) 59 fia7+ <4>f8! 60 <4>e6 h4 61 <4>xf6 (61 1 f7+ *g8 62 *xf6 h3) 61...tf?e8 62 d5 h3 63 c6 <4}d8 64 4*66 b2! with a draw (Korchnoi). However, here too White can win with a cunning intermediate check — 57 Hc7+! After 57.. .<4?g8 now 58 fla7 h5 59 Hxa5 b3 60 Hal! is good, while if 57...<S?f8, then 58 <S?e6 (but not 58 Ha7? b3 59 Hxa5 h5 etc.) 58...a4 (or 58.. .b3 59 d5 and ^xf6) 59 d5 a3 60 <A)xf6 leads to the same situation, where the power of the passed pawns is combined with mating threats to the king. Analysis diagram There is no way of saving the game: 60...<4)g8 61 Bg7+ <4>h8 62 Ha7, or 60...<i?e8 61 Ha7 b3 62 Bxa3 b2 63 Ha8+ <4>d7 64 Hb8 Hxc5 65 Hxb2 Hxd5 66 flb7+, and although Black has exchanged his a- and b-pawns for the white c- and d-pawns, the resulting ending with f-pawn against h-pawn is hopeless for him. Thus the given analysis of the variations with 49 He6! shows that the adjourned posi¬ tion was nevertheless won for White. In reaching this conclusion I was helped not only by a computer, but also in the first instance by intuition. After making a careful study of Korchnoi’s deep analysis, I was imbued with the persistent feeling that White’s positional advantage in this original endgame should be sufficient for a win. And subsequent searches confirmed this... As for 49 4^3?!, the move made in the game, it objectively throws away the win, al¬ though it sets a clever trap. 49.. .He8?! 'Since the pawn endgame is drawn, the rook occupies the important open file. After 49.. .fig3+? 50 4b4 fixh3 Black faces retribu¬ tion for his “pawn-grabbing”: 51 d5 cxd5 52 c6 bxc6 53 a6 and the a-pawn cannot be stopped.’ (Tal). However, after 53...flh4+ 54 4c5 fla4 (Kan) 55 4b6 b4 56 a7 c5 57 4b7 c4 58 He6 flxa7+ 59 4xa7 c3 60 Hc6 d4 it is not Black who loses, but White! Instead of 52 c6? the correct move is 52 He6! Hf3 53 Hb6 Hxf5 54 Bxb7+ 4e6 55 a6 Hfl 56 a7 Hal 57 c6, winning. But a move earlier Black too can play more strongly: 51...Hh4+! 52 4b3 Hh3+ 53 4b2 cxd5 (Kan), gaining a draw: 54 c6 bxc6 55 a6 Hh4 56 4b3 c5 57 Sa2 Sh3+, or 54 He6 b4! 55 Hb6 Ha3 56 Hxb7+ 4e8 57 c6 4d8 58 Hf7 Hxa5 59 Hxf6 4c7. Where then is the win for White? It is pointed out by Korchnoi: 51 a6! bxa6 52 d5! The triumph of the main idea! Black has two replies: 1) 52...cxd5 53 c6 Hh4+ 54 4c5 Ic4+ 55 4xd5 a5 (55...Hcl 56 4d6 and wins — Korchnoi) 56 4d6!

But it should be remembered 143 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors that Korchnoi deliberately avoided this line, which had certainly been analysed in detail by his opponent’s team. Perhaps it was this turn of events that Karpov was aiming for, when he played 49.. JSe8. And Korchnoi, true to his psychological strategy, endeavours to finally divert his opponent from his adjournment analysis. 50.. .Be4 ‘A perfectly sound way to draw.

After reaching the second time control (on the 56th move) Karpov commits a fatal mis¬ take, by making an instinctive move: he wants to active his passed pawns as quickly as possi¬ ble. But Black has no time to advance them! It was essential to combine attack and defence: according to Tal, ‘all Black’s difficulties would have been behind him, had he played 57...fic4! 58 c6 (58 Hg3 fic3 or even 58...^dT) 58.. .Hc3.’ Indeed, in this case the black rook would have successfully supported the advance of its b-pawn and restrained the advance of the en¬ emy c-pawn. A draw follows after both 59 fid6 b3 60 Hxf6 <A>d8 61 2d6+ &e7 (Korchnoi), and 59 Id2 b3 60 Sg2 <4-d8 61 ‘A’b? a5 62 !d2+ <&e7 63 c7 a4 64 c8'# Hxc8 65 "SixcS a3 66 Hd7+, and the strength of the black pawns obliges White to force perpetual check. Commenting on Karpov’s error, the vet¬ eran Soviet master Ilya Kan wrote: ‘This rook ending will join the history of enigmas in the battle for the world championship.’ In my opinion, this is artistic exaggeration: chess his¬ tory knows of much greater ‘enigmas’ — Chi- gorin’s terrible blunder in the 23rd game of his match with Steinitz (Volume 1, Game No. 26), Bronstein’s blackouts during the resumption of the 6th and 23rd games of his match with Botvinnik (Volume 2, Game Nos. 61 and 66), and so on. 58 Hg3 (and suddenly it transpires that there is no longer a draw!) 58...b3 In Tal’s opinion, ‘after 58...flc4 Black would have retained chances of saving the game.’ Other commentators also recom¬ mended this ‘more tenacious’ move.

Why, for almost the third time in a row — a unique record in his glorious career — was Karpov unable to hold an infe¬ rior ending? Of course, it is simplest to refer to the champion's tiredness. But such an ex¬ planation, in my view, belittles the feat of Korchnoi, who, although 20 years older than his opponent, tirelessly and constandy set him new problems. Of course, his fantastic drive and inventiveness, even in a hopeless match situation, also affected Karpov's condition and provoked him into making further mistakes. It is important to note that we are talking not about serious oversights and blunders, but of the gradual deterioration of position: little-by¬ little Korchnoi outplayed his great opponent! I think that these wins are far more weighty than the wins in complicated endings against Polugayevsky or even Spassky in the 1977 matches. Here is the opinion of Korchnoi himself: What in fact happened in the second half of the match? Karpov, who had a colossal psy¬ chological, competitive, chess and, finally, po¬ litical advantage, was not only unable to capi¬ talise on it, but he lost it all along the way. The only concession to which the Soviet side agreed — to remove their psychologist out of my field of vision — cost the champion dearly. Karpov lost his best qualities, and in particular his keen psychological evaluation of the posi¬ tion! This is a kind of knowledge of the im¬ pression of the position that your opponent has. The ability to understand the course of his thinking — this means a great deal! It means reducing by at least a half the analysis of pos¬ sible replies by the opponent, and, to put it simply, anticipating what he will do. Karpov possesses this quality more than anyone else — arid he lost it! In this respect he looked so powerful in the 13th game and the first half of the 17th, but he looked equally helpless in the 29th and the 31st! It was evident that he had completely lost confidence in himself.' Objectively speaking, it should be remarked that it was not at all because of Zukhar’s ab¬ sence from the front rows of the hall that Korchnoi won these three games. He fought like a lion! Some six years later his heroic ex¬ ample inspired me in the even more hopeless situation, which arose after the 27th game of my first match with Karpov (1984/85). And the events at the finish of the match in Baguio were to some extent a prototype of the drama that was played out in the last third of our Moscow match and especially its concluding days. However, about this in Volume 7... Here, after the 31st game, victory in the match would go to the player who scored the first win. Karpov took a time-out and, in or¬ der to somehow dispel and reduce the stress, he travelled with Sevastyanov to Manila, where he furiously supported ‘our' team in the USSR-Yugoslavia world basketball champion¬ ship. And in the meantime in Baguio, ‘our' other team launched a decisive offensive against the yogis — at that moment the Soviet side had everything under control. Schmid had left after the 27th game (he had pressing matters in Germany), and was re¬ placed on the jury by the new chief arbiter — Filip from ‘fraternal' Czechoslovakia. Euwe, who had arrived for the finish of the match, also left, alas — precisely after the 31st game. ‘Karpov had to wait for the departure of Euwe, the only person by whom the Soviets were slightly restrained,’ writes Korchnoi. ‘The President left Baguio at the most heated days 145 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors of the match, so as to put in order... the Vene¬ zuelan Chess Federation. Apparently this was more important than the question of who would become world champion. True, before his departure, in a conversation with Keene and Frau Leeuwerik, Euwe said that if the Soviets were to victimise the yogis again, he would permit me to stop the match.’ The attack began on 14th October with a press conference by Campomanes, which stated that the ‘criminals’ Dwyer and Shep- perd were again visiting the hotel where the challenger was living and using the official match transport, and he demanded of Korchnoi ‘the observance of norms of de¬ cency and respect to the organisers’. In reply Korchnoi invited journalists to his place, and under the guidance of Dada and Didi he per¬ formed a series of yoga exercises. The next day, on the eve of the 32nd game, the Soviet delegation made a written demand to the jury that the ‘criminal terrorists’ should be removed from the match. Here is a note¬ worthy extract: The match organiser Mr F.Campomanes has several times officially demanded the termination of this connection and in his memorandum of 13th September (after the 21st game — G.K) he warned about the possibility of terminating the match in the aim of ensuring individual and public security. However, the connection of the members of the challenger’s delegation with the criminal element has continued.’ As we see, back in 1978 Campomanes and the Karpov team were conceiving the possibility of terminating the match. When the score became 5-5, rumours began to circulate that the Soviet delegation, concerned about the state of the champion’s health, had suggested that FIDE should terminate the match — in which case Karpov would, of course, retain his title. And at some point Euwe had supposedly said to Keene that with the scores equal the match should be terminated. Such a scenario could have come about, for example, in the event of a draw in the 32nd game. It is quite possible that this idea was suggested to Dr Euwe. At any event, six and a half years later it was put into effect with the formal approach by Se- vastyanov to another FIDE President — Cam¬ pomanes, when he terminated my first match with Karpov in a similar situation and under the same pretext... On the day of the 32nd game, 17th Octo¬ ber, a crucial meeting of the jury took place, and Keene, who by that time had become the head of the challenger’s delegation, ‘after be¬ ing obstinate for the sake of appearances, agreed to remove the yogis from Baguio’. And at two o’clock in the afternoon, without Korchnoi’s knowledge — ‘all the power and information was then with Keene’ — they left his villa. According to Korchnoi, when he arrived for the game the hall resembled an arena of police manoeuvres: the building was full of uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Before the game he chanced to see ‘on the faces of the Soviets a suppressed sense of triumph, malicious glee.’ And he went on... ‘The game began. The directors of Soviet chess were sit¬ ting in the front row of the stalls, and in the 4th row was... our old acquaintance — Zukhar!’ At about a quarter to eight Stean telegrammed a protest to Dr Euwe. But it was already too late... The challenger played badly and ad¬ journed the game in a hopeless position (Game No. 77). The following morning ‘on his own initia¬ tive’ Keene phoned Filip and informed him of Korchnoi’s resignation! But the latter, in turn, wrote Filip a letter: ‘I shall not resume the 32nd game, But I am not going to sign the score-sheet because the game was played un¬ der absolutely illegal conditions...’ Korchnoi protested to FIDE and did not appear at the closing ceremony. This was also my protest against the behaviour of the Sovi¬ ets and Campomanes. In a match, which was transformed into a blood battle, where with the complicity of the jury all concepts of fair play were rejected, where rules and agree- 146 Viktor the Terrible ments were unscrupulously broken — in such a competition, even the closing ceremony turns into a place of execution for a person without rights.’ This painful defeat effectively signified the collapse of Korchnoi’s hopes of ever becom¬ ing world champion. This makes it all the more surprising that, immediately after the match, whereas the young champion went off Tor a well-eamed rest’ (such a thing also hap¬ pens nowadays), the 47-year-old challenger found in himself the strength to lead the Swiss team at the Olympiad in Buenos Aires and to achieve the best result on board one: +7=4. After all his trials in the Philippines this looked incredible! And on the results of 1978 Korchnoi was deservedly awarded the only chess ‘Oscar’ in his career, and therefore one that was especially precious. Last Battle for the Throne The strict boycott on the part of the Soviet Federation forced Korchnoi to miss at least two major tournaments in 1979 - Montreal (1-2. Karpov and Tal) and Tilburg (1. Kar¬ pov). But his performances in other events were fully at the level of a vice-world cham¬ pion: a share of lst-2nd places with Ljubojevic in Sao Paulo and Buenos-Aires (overall score: +15=11), and wins in a four-player match- tournament in South Africa and the Swiss Open Championship — 12 out of 13, 4Vz points ahead of the second prize-winner. In the winter, preparing for the next Can¬ didates cycle, Korchnoi played in Linares (2nd-4th places) and Wijk aan Zee (3rd), see¬ ing as there were no USSR representatives. The form he acquired helped him to com¬ fortably overcome the first difficult barrier — the quarter-final match with Petrosian (Vel- den, March 1980). This was a 10-game match and Korchnoi, after winning the 5th and 9th games with seven draws, won ahead of sched¬ ule by 5V2-3V2. And just a month later he shared lst-3rd places with Andersson and Miles at a tournament in London. The next test, like three years earlier, was a semi-final match with Polugayevsky (Buenos Aires, summer 1980), this time of ‘just’ 12 games. This new duel proved very difficult for Korchnoi: he was quite unable to win with White! Polugayevsky, who was on the crest of a wave (he had beaten Tal in the quarter-final) put up a far more tenacious resistance than in Evian. After losing an almost level rook end¬ game in the 4th game, he won the 6th; after losing the 8th he drew level with the help of a brilliant novelty in the 12th (Volume 3, Game No.27) and again levelled the scores: 6-6. After this the regulations stipulated two ad¬ ditional games, in the event of 1-1 — a further two, and if the scores were still equal the win¬ ner of the match would be the player who had won more games with Black (viz, Korchnoi). So, a classic tie-break of two games began. In the 13 th game Korchnoi was again unable to make use of the white pieces; moreover, in an uneasy endgame with knight against bishop he had to seal the only saving move! Many, including the chief arbiter Najdorf, thought that the adjourned position was lost for White, but on the resumption Korchnoi accurately forced a draw. A highly intriguing situation arose, since Polugayevsky could be satisfied only with a win — either in the 14th game, or, in the event of a draw, in one of next two addi¬ tional games. Chess fans wondered: would the Soviet grandmaster be able to repeat the miracle that he had performed in the 12th game? What happened next was eloquently described by Korchnoi’s press attache Em¬ manuel Sztein: ‘The decisive, 14th game began on Sunday at 4 p.m. Again, we had the black pieces. What opening should be chosen? Korchnoi with his coaches, grandmasters Stean and Seirawan, had been up all night, polishing a sharp line of play in the English Opening, where Black checks with his knight at d3 and White loses the chance to castle. The variation was risky, but Korchnoi was counting on the element of 147 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors surprise: if his opponent played the old way, we would spring on him an improvement found by Michael Stean... At the same time the Hiibner-Portisch match was being played in Italy, and Bent Larsen was there as corre¬ spondent for the Argentine newspaper Clarin. When I went out for the newspapers the next morning and opened Clarin, I was dumb¬ founded — there was the entire variation! In full! It turned out that it had been played in a game between Hiibner and Portisch the pre¬ vious day, which ended in a draw. But Larsen! Larsen, who was very familiar with this line of play, showed how Black could have improved. But before that he showed an improvement for White. An unpleasant surprise! When I returned to the hotel room, they were, of course, sitting there preparing. I showed them the newspaper, producing near panic. We didn’t know what to do and were close to despair. Viktor and I went for a stroll, and at one point I said, ‘‘There’s only one way out: you have to stake your all. Serov (the leader of the Soviet delegation. - G.K) is unlikely to read Spanish. Nor is he likely to buy newspapers for hard currency. As for the embassy, they won’t send the papers until tomorrow — after all, it’s a Sunday!” Viktor was lost in thought.. Finally, the game began, and — Korchnoi chose that very line of play! I said to them, “Relax.” Indeed, the critical position in that line of play comes somewhere on the 14th or 15th move: it was either or... I watched Viktor rush off the stage and pace about in his cage¬ like rest room. He was waiting! like a beast in ambush, waiting to pounce... Of course Po- lugayevsky didn’t know about the newspaper — and it was effectively all over in 10 minutes! And a couple of days later Larsen wrote a piece in Chain under the heading “Those who don’t read Larsen land in trouble!’” Such an amazing story could only happen, of course, in the pre-computer, pre-internet era. Polugayevsky’s downfall was caused by the tortoise-like speed with which information spread... Let us analyse this dramatic game, the first 14 moves of which coincided with the 5th game of the ‘parallel’ Candidates match Hiib- ner-Portisch. Game 34 L.Polugayevsky-V.Korchnoi Candidates Match, Buenos Aires 1980,14th game _English Opening A34_ 1 2 c4 c5 In the preceding even-numbered games of the match Korchnoi played only 2...b6, result¬ ing in the Queen’s Indian Defence (Volume 3, Game No. 27). 3 £ic3 d5 4 cxd5 £ixd5 5 e4 (a popular move at that time) 5...£)b4 6 Ac4 £id3 + The sensational game Polugayevsky-Tal (Riga Interzonal 1979) went 6..Jte6 7 jtxe6 4M3+ 8 <S?fl fxe6 9 £)g5 Wb6!? 10 ®e2? c4 with excellent play for Black (Volume 2y Game Nod45), but already in 1980 the strong reply 10 Wf3! had been found. 7 *e2 £if4+ The exchange 7...4^xcl-f- 8 flxcl has been judged to favour White since the time of Takacs’s games against Spielmann (Vienna 1928) and Rubinstein (Rogaska Slatina 1929), and also Botvinnik against Kasparian (1938). 8 sbf'1 This knight manoeuvre also used to be considered inadequate — on account of the following pawn sacrifice. However, Portisch, 148 Viktor the Terrible and immediately after him Korchnoi and Stean, worked out a new plan of development for Black 9 b4!? After the quiet 9 4ie5 (Averbakh- Bondarevsky, Moscow 1946) Black’s most successful reply has been 9...g6. 9.. .cxb4 Soon, following the example of Tony Miles, an interesting pawn sacrifice came to the fore - 9...g6!? 10 bxc5 k,gl 11 ±xe6 ±xe6 12 d4 £k6 13 Ae3 with a sharp, unclear game (Sei- rawan-Miles, London 1982; Kasparov-Shirov, Pestovo simultaneous 1986; Vallejo-Leko, Linares 2003). Theory has not yet given a final verdict on this variation. It is often avoided both by Black, and by White: it is too risky a venture! 10£>d5 At that time this was the main continuation. White seizes space, develops his cl-bishop on a splendid diagonal and apparently gains very good prospects. But Portisch was able to overcome this optical illusion and re-evaluate the resulting positions.’ (Makarichev) Later 10 4ie2! was deemed to be stronger: 10.. .£>c7 (now 10...g6? is bad on account of 11 ±b2 ±,g7 12 ±xe6! Axb2 13 Axf7+) 11 d4 e6 12 h4 with excellent compensation for the pawn (Hubner-Tukmakov, Wijk aan Zee 1984; Kasparov-Griinberg, Hamburg simulta¬ neous 1985). 10.. .g6! This discovery virtually overturned the evaluation of the position! Black solves the problem of his kingside development, and in the resulting "Grunfeld’ set-ups it is White who has to play accurately, since his predomi¬ nance in the centre does not compensate for the drawbacks of his king’s position at fl. 11 $Lb2 (11 a3 Jtg7 12 flbl 4k6 with equal¬ ity is no better for White) 11...jtg7 12 JLxg7 £>xg7 13 £ixb4 0-0 But not immediately 13...jtg4? in view of 14 JLd7+ <A>xf7 15 <53e5+ or 15 4ig5+. 14 d4? It is strange, but both Hiibner and Po- lugayevsky were let down by their sense of danger. The move in the game looks natural, but it allows the opponent to make an imme¬ diate attack on White’s centre. And although this is not yet finally catastrophic, it was far more circumspect to play 14 h3 with equality, as recommended by Larsen and many other commentators. 14...jLg4 "Here Polugayevsky thought for 30 minutes and for the first time he “did not guess” the move made by Hiibner. Indeed, things are not at all easy for White: he effectively has a “Griinfeld” with a bad king and the knight at £3 already pinned.’ (Makarichev) 15<i?e2?! Hiibner chose 15 Wd2, and after 15..Jhd3 16 gxf3 Zhc6 (16...a5!?) 17 <§}xc6 bxc6 Portisch achieved a comfortable game — if 18 ifeg2 there 149 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors can follow 18...e5! 19 fihdl exd4 20 ®xd4 Wh4.

But Hubner miraculously managed to save the game (and in the end, after a series of draws, he won the match: 6V2AV2). In the opinion of grandmaster Makarichev, "White should have played 15 d5 and begun the withdrawal of his forces (bishop to e2, b4- knight via the route c2-e3 or d3-e5), avoiding losses if possible.’ But here too after 15...4M7 Black has an excellent game: if 16 Jte2, then 16.. .f5! is strong. 115.. .Wd6! 16 Wd2 <£e6 17 ±xe6 (White is now forced to give up bishop for knight) 17.. .®xe6 18<&>e3?! "This manoeuvre has its logic: 4ie5 is threatened. Despite everything, White fights for the initiative!’ (Makarichev). Even so, this is a mistake which aggravates White’s difficul¬ ties. Of course, Polugayevsky realised that it was bad to move his king into the centre, but he wanted to eliminate the pin. Black’s unex¬ pected novelty had obviously upset his mental equilibrium (it is no secret that he usually did not react in the best way in such situations). 18 Wd3 came into consideration, with the idea of developing the hi-rook and playing ^fl. In this case the sharp 18...f5 19 e5 a5 (Sveshnikov) is refuted by the computer stroke 20 Wb3! ttxb3 21 axb3 with a saving pin on the a-file. And although after 18...fid8 or 18...4}d7 Black would have retained an ap¬ preciable advantage, in view of the insecurity of the white king and the eccentric position of the knight at b4. White’s position would still have been defensible. 18.. .f5!

The only way of retaining chances of saving the game was by the activation of the ill-starred knight — 22 150 Viktor the Terrible 4M5, in order after 22...JLxf3+ 23 gxf3 24 ‘2ixf6+ flxf6 25 ffhcl Se6+ 26 *f4 ld8 27 fic7 Bxd4+ 28 ^*g3 Bb4 to invade the 7th rank with the rooks: 29 fidl! <A>f7 30 Sdd7 Se2 31 a3 ffbl 32 &g2 Bbb2 33 &g3 etc. However, 22...e6! would have left Black with an obvious advantage, after both 23 £lc7 Bac8 24 Ba(h)cl lf5! or 23 £>f4(c3) jtxO+ 24 gxB fif5!, and 23 £3e3 £tf6+, since 24 ^>d3 Axf3 25 gxf3 5M5!, 24 &f4 ±xf3 25 gxB Bad8 and 24 i’eS flad8 etc. are all insufficient. 22.. .5.5!

Despite the absence of the queens, the position has not lost its middlegame features: there are still plenty of pieces on the board, and Black’s chances of creating threats to the white king are far from exhausted, to say nothing about an attack on the weak white pawns. 23 Bc7?!

But, to all appearances, the peak of Korchnoi’s form had already passed, and a certain crisis was apparent. It is probable that his age was beginning to tell — after all one’s energy reserve is not unlimited — as well as his lack of appearances in the strongest tourna¬ ments: to maintain the required form one must constantly play with players of equal class! Whereas Korchnoi’s first match with Polugayevsky had indicated an unprecedented creative surge (undoubtedly associated with moving to the West: he had become a free man), the second match proclaimed that the end of the golden period of his career was approaching. Things were also very difficult for Korchnoi in the final Candidates match with the outstanding German grandmaster Robert Hiibner (Merano, winter 1980/81), one of the rare world-class players in history who has been successful not only in chess — he is a prominent philologist, and the author of nu¬ merous scientific works (to say nothing of his chess articles and commentaries). Many players of the older generation re¬ member the remarkable finishing spurt of the young Hiibner at the Interzonal tournament in Mallorca (1970), his confident, mature play in the match with Petrosian (1971) and his unex¬ pected resignation of the match after six draws and a loss from a good position in the 7th; another tragic defeat at the hands of Petrosian came at the finish of the Interzonal touma- 151 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ment in Biel (1976), which denied him a place in the Candidates matches. But in the next cycle Dr Hiibner attained the peak of his ca¬ reer: he shared lst-3rd places with Petrosian and Portisch in the Interzonal tournament (Rio de Janeiro 1979), then won matches against Adorjan and Portisch, and began splendidly in the final encounter with Viktor ^ the Terrible... Back in 1973 they had met in a training match of eight games, won by Korchnoi not without difficulty (AVz-iVi). But now Hiibner was 32 years old, at the height of his creative powers, playing confidently and tenaciously — and after six games he was leading: +2—1=3. In the 7th game — a French with 3 <S3d2 — he obtained clearly the better endgame with a pair of powerful bishops. Korchnoi defended re¬ sourcefully, and on the resumption, in a sharp time scramble, he succeeded in equalising. A draw was now inevitable, but on the 63rd move Hiibner suddenly missed a knight check and lost a rook! ‘Sensing blood’, he won the 8th game in a forceful and technical manner, and took the lead for the first time in the match: AV2-V/2. This was the psychological turning point. The next game was adjourned in a roughly level ending, and then came the 10th game, which was also adjourned, but with an obvious ad¬ vantage for Korchnoi. The next day the media agencies an¬ nounced to the world the sensational news that Hiibner had refused to resume the game and had resigned the match! Yet the match was the best of 16 games, and the probable 6-4 score was by no means catastrophic. But after his tragic blunder of a rook, Hiibner had apparendy lost faith in himself... At any event, despite all the difficulties, Korchnoi won his second successive Candidates cycle — previ¬ ously this had been achieved only by Smyslov and Spassky. But to become a finalist also in two other cycles (1968 and 1974) — this had not been achieved by anyone! It was also there in Merano that the next world championship match Karpov-Korchnoi (October-November 1981) took place. It should have started earlier, but the new FIDE President Fridrik Olafsson deferred the match for a month, ‘wishing to secure equal condi¬ tions for both contestants’, i.e. finally to gain permission for the Korchnoi family to leave the USSR. Nothing came of this, but a year later, in the election of the FIDE President at the Congress in Lucerne, the Soviet bloc countries refused to support Olafsson, and gave their preference to Campomanes... The Soviet authorities did everything possi¬ ble to help Karpov fulfil the parting words which resounded from the lips of Brezhnev himself: You’ve seized the crown, now hang on to it!’ This match was accompanied by an unprecedented patriotic campaign. Karpov was given the best trainers and all the help that could be provided by the state apparatus. The atmosphere of suspicion surrounding the bat¬ tle in Merano can be judged from the fact that a Soviet delegation — including Karpov — went there a few weeks before the start of the match, to check the drinking water, climatic conditions, and the level of noise and radia¬ tion (this was revealed to the press by the chairman of the organising committee). The public was staggered by the ten enor¬ mous containers brought to the match by the Karpov team. Pictures of these appeared in the Italian newspapers under garish headlines, such as ‘The Russians’ secret weapon?’ But Baturinsky explained that the experience of the more than three months spent in Baguio had been taken into account: ‘Who knows how long the present match will last? There is much that has to be provided. Card indexes, chess books, theoretical material, the results of the many days of preparatory work... This part of the load can be considered a secret weapon. Also needed were medication, foodstuffs, sports equipment. And so it accumulated, a whole ton of goods.’ The match turned out to be not so tough as the one in Baguio. Although Korchnoi had 152 Viktor the Terrible been maintaining his vigour by playing in non¬ elite tournaments throughout the year, he no longer had the energy to oppose his thor¬ oughly armed young opponent. They again played to six wins, and the start proved dis¬ heartening for the challenger — three defeats in four games! The cause of this was not even Karpov’s super preparation in the opening, but the openly poor play of Korchnoi, who not so much allowed himself to be outplayed, but rather outplayed himself. As it transpired, right from the start his blood pressure jumped and his eyes began to hurt and to water — this had never happened to him before. Years later Viktor Lvovich recalled: Tn Merano Karpov “with his comrades” (there were 43 such comrades, and as many as 70 at the end of the match) forced me to endure a nightmare.’ He was convinced that the latest achievements of Soviet intelligence had been used against him. There is no doubt that Kar¬ pov’s people were sitting in the front row and using instruments to study my condition — pulse and so on. In addition, I was irradiated — either in the auditorium, or at the country house where I was staying.’ His press attache Emmanuel Sztein also though that £in Merano there was something sinister’, and he de¬ scribed in an interview how he had come across three strangers in his hotel room, rummaging through his papers, and how one of them squirted something in his eyes, after which he lost consciousness and later had great problems with his blood pressure and his sight... Yes, police control and the activity of spe¬ cial intelligence services were a characteristic feature of several world championship en¬ counters, beginning with the Spassky-Fischer match. However, I don’t know anything about secret instruments and the irradiating of one of the contestants. Therefore I can only con¬ firm Korchnoi’s words, that during such matches all sorts of devilry occurs. And not least because a player’s nervous system experi¬ ences incomparable stress. All the same, Korchnoi found in himself the strength to continue the battle, although at that moment it was not clear how he could change the unfortunate course of the match. In the 5th game he unsuccessfully tried for more than thirty moves to win a rook end¬ game with four pawns against three on one flank. At that time I was playing in Tilburg, and I remember commenting in surprise: ‘Why waste so much time? It’s a dead draw!’ But Petrosian and Spassky did not agree, and they explained to me the point of Korchnoi’s tactics: on the day after such an adjournment session it is very difficult to play for a win with White... And the 6th game reminded the world of the former Korchnoi! Whereas in the 2nd game after 1 e4 e5 2 £sf3 he had replied with the modest 2...£lc6 3 Jtb5 £if6, and in the 4th he had altogether diverged with 2...£if6, now, when there was nothing to lose, he de¬ cided to renew the theoretical duel, begun in Baguio, in his favourite Open Variation of the Spanish. It can be considered that it was with this game that the real match began - with a tense, uncompromising struggle and critical opening duels.

Instead of 12...1g4 (Game No.75), Korchnoi adopted a variation which had been 153 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors studied back in 1955 by Geller and his second Bondarevsky in preparations for the match with Smyslov for the tide of USSR Champion.

Here Korchnoi held his ground with Black against Hubner (Chicago 1982; Lucerne Olympiad 1982) and Lobron (Paris 1984), but Karpov with White defeated Yusupov (50th USSR Championship, Moscow 1983). However, from the late 1980s they began answering 16 <£kl2 with 16...f6!, for example: 17 ffcl fxe5 18 £\xe4 dxe4 19 d5 20 jtc5 Hf7 with equality (Ivanchuk-Grischuk, Rethymnon 2003). 16.. .a3 A useful inclusion — both for the middle- game, and for the endgame, where the weak¬ ness of the a2-pawn is especially sensitive.

On this oc¬ casion Black attacks the centre from the other side, without hurrying to occupy the b4-square with his knight 18 exf6 Terhaps this move involves some over¬ sight now Black achieves a good game in the centre and on the kingside.’ (Geller). 18 £3 fxe5! 19 fxe4 (19 dxe5? d4l) 19...Bxfl+ 20 ttxfl exd4 etc. is also unfavourable for White.

Hiibner attaches a question mark to this ‘inexplicable’ move and recommends 23 f3. Indeed, after 23...&c3 24 ±d2!

Geller, Nunn and Suetin suggested the ‘sound’ 23 <SM3 (getting rid of the unpleasant knight at b4), although, in my view, after 23...£lc6! Black’s chances are somewhat bet¬ ter. From the standpoint of playing to main¬ tain the balance, 23 Axe4 dxe4 24 We2 and Bel was possible. 23 Wcl is a more ambitious move: White is threatening after Bel and f3-f3 to take control of the c5-square and to exert pressure on the c-file. But Black’s reply disrupts these plans. After the game Karpov admitted that in his 155 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors preparations and during the game itself he had underestimated the dangers concealed in White’s position. 23.. .C5! A radical solution to the problem! Black sacrifices a pawn, but he gets rid of his weak¬ ness at c7, opens the c-file and obtains a passed d-pawn — how many pluses for a slight material deficit! 24 dxc5 Otherwise ...c5-c4. But if 24 jtxe4?! Wxe4 25 Wxc5, then 25...£*c2 with strong counter¬ play — Tal and Geller gave the variation 26 lacl Sac8! 27 fTxb5 £lxe3 28 ffxc8 flxc8 29 £xe3 + 30 ^hl Bel. White also has a difficult endgame after 28...£ixfl!? 29 Bxe8+ Jtxe8 30 Wxd5+ Wxd5 31 ^xd5 <§^d2, again because of the ‘Achilles’ heel’ at a2. 24.. .#f6 ‘Now there is a dispute for the d4-square.’ (Hiibner). At the same time, it is not so easy for White to coordinate the actions of his pieces. 25 Jtxe4 After the clever 25 Wdl!? with the idea of 25.. .Kxal? 26 ±d4 Wxbl 27 Wxbl ^d2 28 ®f5 £htfl 29 #g5 jk,g6 30 ^xg6 and wins (Nunn), or 25...£k3?! 26 ±d4! 4kdl 27 Axf6 gxf6 28 Bxdl, the simple 25...Bad8! could have followed, with sufficient counterplay. 25.. .5.e4 Threatening ...Bxf4 and ...^d3, as well as ...d5-d4. 26 4be2?! ‘According to Tal, initially the world cham¬ pion had been planning 26 Wd2, in order to pin down the d5-pawn by the attack on the knight at b4, but then he did not like 26...Wb2.

In addi¬ tion, Black is not averse to seizing control of the e-file. 31 Sfdl 156 Viktor the Terrible 31 fifel Wb2 (31 Jtd5 32 Af4) 32 && would appear to be better, but after 32...fixe 1 + 33 fixel fle8 34 flxe8+ Jtxe8 35 f3 Jtg6 36 £k!6 ^3d4! the weakness of White’s queenside would have caused him a mass of problems. 31...JLg6 32 Jte3 Se6 (with the intention of ...flae8) 33 I.f4 #f6 (33...Wb2 34 h4!?) 34 fiel fiae8 35 fixe6 fixe6 36 fibl?

In the 8th and 10th games he played 1 e4 e5 2 4k6 3 JLc4, and in the 12th — 1 c4, but all of them, as well as the 7th and 11th, ended in draws. During those days, on the directive of the Sports Committee, a group of grandmasters was urgently assembled at the Olympic training base in Novogorsk on the outskirts of Moscow, day and night analysing topical opening variations, including the Open Variation of the Spanish. In the 9th game the champion employed a strong and unexpected novelty in the Queen’s Gambit and accurately took advantage of his opponent’s uncertain play (Game No. 84). The score became 4-1 and, of course, few believed that a repetition of Baguio was possible: Kar¬ pov only needed to win two more games, and he still had ample strength (true, miracles sometimes occur: in his first match with me, he was even leading 4-0 after nine games!). However, in the 13th game a warning signal sounded for the entire enormous Soviet team: Korchnoi scored his second win in the match in very good style.

It is interesting that in the resulting complicated position Korchnoi also succeeded in completely outplaying his formi¬ dable opponent. 7...A.e6 (7...±g6 8 h4!) 8 h3 The sharper continuation 8 h4 4}d7 (8...iLxh4P! 9 ®b3!) 9 h5 Wb6 (Botvinnik- Spassky, Leiden 1970) has already been de¬ scribed in Volume 2 (Game No. 71), while 158 Viktor the Terrible 9.. .^h6!? (Kasparov-Karpov, 21st match- game, Moscow 1985) will be analysed in detail in Volume 7. 8.. .^f6 It Is not clear what can be bad about the quiet development of the knight, but at the same time Black has often experienced diffi¬ culties and many games have ended sadly for him. 8...Jtd6 9 £)ge2 ^e7 10 Wb3 is also considered to favour White (Korchnoi- Spassky, 2nd matchgame, Kiev 1968).

Geller-. Spassky, Moscow 1967) 14 exd4, as in the 14th game of the Botvinnik-Petrosian match {Volume 2y Game No. 71). 13 2d 13 dxc5 Jtxc5 (Bronstein-Kuijpers, Am¬ sterdam 1968) is somewhat premature, since Black acquires the threat of ...d5-d4. 13..JSe8? It is hard to believe that such a natural move can be bad. Korchnoi, Keene and many other commentators recommended 13...a6. Indeed, in this case 14 dxc5 is no longer effec¬ tive: 14.. Jkxc5 15 £}b5 £}b4l or 15 a3 d4 with equality. Karpov decided to maintain the ten¬ sion,' setting Korchnoi a comparatively new problem, but the latter copes with it impecca¬ bly. 14 dxc5! jtxc5 15 £>b5 White occupies the d4-square with gain of tempo and gains an enduring advantage thanks to his control of the centre, spatial su¬ periority and greater activity of his pieces — in particular his bishops, which control the key diagonals. It would appear that such a position with an ‘isolani’ should suit Black, since the white king is too exposed. But here the g4-pawn is not so much a weakness, as an outpost, re¬ stricting the mobility of the enemy pieces and creating the threat of g4-g5. In addition. White also has dangerous threats on the queenside, where his pieces are far better placed for ac¬ tion. And, strangely enough, Black is obliged to solve difficult and unpleasant problems: he has not even a hint of real counterplay. 15.„Jtf8 (15...1§b6? 16 Jtc7 and wins, while if 15...1tfe7, then 16 £}g5 is good) 16 $ifd4! ‘Karpov had only been expecting 16 4^bd4 and now, uncharacteristically, he sank into 159 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors thought for 35 minutes.’ (Keene). Now Black must all the time reckon with the exchange ^xe6, which will rid him of his ‘isolani’, but will give him new weaknesses and strengthen the threat of g4-g5 followed by Wh5 and a terribly strong attack on the king. 16.. .£)xd4 It is a mistake to play 16...®d7? 17 ^xe6 Bxe6 18 Jtf5 or 17...fxe6 18 g5. ‘According to the champion, he rejected the previously in¬ tended 16..JBb6 on account of 17 Wb3 ^a5 18 Hfa4 Jld7 19 jtf5 with the advantageous exchange of bishops.’ (Geller). However, after 19.. .±xf5 20 £kf5 Hc4 21 Bxc4 <£)xc4 22 b3 Zhb2 23 ®d4 iH^xbS 24 ®xb2 these advan¬ tages are slight. Tal and Geller parried 17 Wb3 with 17„.<S3xd4 18 ^xd4 (18 exd4 Sc4!) 18.. .®xb3, thinking that after 19 <S3xb3 White has only a minimal advantage. However, after 16.,.Wb6 Korchnoi was in fact planning 17 ^xe6l, which also in my view was far more promising: 17...Bxe6 18 <S3d4 Bee8 19 ®b3! and the white bishops domi¬ nate — Black faces a very difficult endgame, or 17.. .fxe6 18 g5 thdl (if 18...^e4, then 19 £>c3! <53xc3? 20 Jlxh7+ is strong, or 19...ficd8 20 %4) 19 Wh5 g6 20 ^xg6 hxg6 21 Wxg6+ 4>h8 (21...Ag7?! 22 £>d6! etc.) 22 the!

In all these variations the difference in the activity of the white and black pieces is obvious. 18 exd4! Perhaps Karpov was expecting the ‘tradi¬ tional’ 18 ^3xd4. 18...®d7 If 18...a6 Korchnoi gave 19 £kl6, gaining the advantage of the two bishops, but 19 ^c7 Be7 20 lfc2 is also good.

The general opinion was that this was a se¬ rious loss of time, although it is already hard to offer Black any good advice: after 21.. Jtd6 (Korchnoi) the simplest is 22 #f3, while if 21.. .ttT7 in the hope of 22 g5?l £>h5 and ...4tif4+ with counterplay on the dark squares (Tal, Geller), then 22 We2! Karpov clearly underestimated the conse¬ quences of the exchange on e6 and sensed too late the danger of his position. He was think¬ ing in the general terms of positions with an ‘isolanf (inferior for Black, but defensible), whereas Korchnoi exploited the concrete fea¬ tures of the given position. The problems fac¬ ing Black proved far more serious than at first sight, and in addition they began to snowball... 22 g5 (beginning a decisive attack) 22...5ie4 After the passive 22...£le8 23 ®g4 flc6 24 h4 (Korchnoi) Black dies of suffocation. Therefore Karpov sharpens the play, and his idea proves justified.7 (Geller) 23 %4! In the event of 23 Axe4 dxe4 24 flxe4 ®d5 (Keene) the play would have enlivened somewhat, although after 25 We2! White would still retain an advantage (25...®xa2 26 Hxe6).

But their variation 27...^e4 28 Sxe4?! dxe4 29 Ac4 Ue8 30 f5 is not convinc¬ ing on account of 30...e3! with sharp play.

Without resum¬ ing the game. Black resigned. The score became 4-2, and the Soviet au¬ thorities, deciding that the match situation was becoming sharper, declared a general mobilisa¬ tion. Even I, an 18-year-old, was summoned by the Chairman of the KGB in Azerbaijan and handed a demand from Moscow: it was neces¬ sary to unearth some new ideas for White in the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez! With this same aim, the head of the Sports Commit- 162 Viktor the Terrible tee chess administration, grandmaster Krogius, phoned Baku. I was told that it was my patri¬ otic duty: the ‘traitor’ had to be smashed at any price. Not having any desire to work for Kar¬ pov, I replied that I didn’t see any particular need for such assistance: as it was, Korchnoi was bound to lose. But they insistently sug¬ gested that I should ‘think again’. I remember that I consulted with Botvin- nik, and he said Karpov could and should be helped, but only if he wasn’t leading in the match. Fortunately for me, while I was ‘think¬ ing’, others helped the Soviet champion and, by breaching the Open Variation in two games, the 14th (Game No.85) and the 18th {Game No.86) he confidently won the match: 6-2. Nevertheless, as I later found out, Karpov phoned Krogius and asked whether Kasparov had sent anything from Baku: he wanted to know what his potential rival thought.. Korchnoi left the battlefield with a heavy heart *1 endured Moscow, I endured Baguio, but Merano I could not endure. Therefore I gave my word: never to play a match with Karpov again,’ he was to say ten years later. TMot wishing to endure again that which hap¬ pened to me in Merano, from being a profes¬ sional I have gradually readjusted to becoming an amateur. Now I have no ambitions. I want to play interesting chess, and I am succeeding in this.’ Farewell to the Dream In 1982 Korchnoi played in five tournaments and won three of them, but on account of the Soviet boycott he was again forced to miss the most important events of the year: Hastings, Wijk aan Zee, Mar del Plata, Sarajevo, Dort¬ mund, London, Bugojno, Turin, Tilburg... In the autumn Viktor Lvovich headed the Swiss team at the Olympiad in Lucerne, and in the 10th round I first met him one-to-one. In general I was then playing on board two, with Karpov on board one. But the world cham¬ pion diplomatically avoided a meeting with his implacable opponent: he would have had Black and, apparently, did not consider it nec¬ essary to take a risk Besides, it was a conven¬ ient opportunity to ‘put me up’ against Korchnoi and see what came of this. A very sharp battle in a Modem Benoni de¬ veloped: I played extremely riskily, but in the end, after wild complications and mutual mis¬ takes in time-trouble, I won — this duel will be annotated anew in the planned book of my selected games. Incidentally, before the start of the game, disdaining the official ban, I made a move¬ ment towards my opponent to make the cus¬ tomary handshake. But Korchnoi declined — as I initially thought, remembering his bitter experience of Baguio and Merano, where a handshake was out of the question. But later it transpired that in Lucerne the three well- known chess defectors — Viktor Korchnoi (Switzerland), Lev Alburt (USA) and Igor Ivanov (Canada) had agreed among them¬ selves not to offer to shake hands before a game, to avoid putting me in an uncomfort¬ able position! At the previous Olympiad (Malta 1980) Karpov had ignored Alburt’s outstretched hand, and this photo had been published throughout the western press... Korchnoi concluded that year with a short training match with Timman: 3-3 (+1— 1=4). And at the start of 1983, just before the Candidates matches, he also played in Wijk aan Zee, where he was extremely un¬ compromising, but had his worst result for many years (+5—6=2). Nevertheless, he conducted the quarter-final match with Por- tisch (Bad Kissingen, spring 1983) as in the good old days. The start of this match resembled the rout of Polugayevsky in Evian (1977). In the 1st game Korchnoi chose a rare variation of the English Opening, and although Black achieved good play (cf. Volume 3, Game No. 71) Portisch used up nearly all the time on his clock, and was unable to hold a roughly equal, rook endgame in time-trouble. In the 2nd game he obtained a typical ‘anti-Grtinfeld’ 163 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ending, favourable for White, but with his inaccurate 36th move he squandered all his winning chances. It is probable that the bur¬ den of these mistakes affected Porrisch in the 3rd game, which became the culmination of the match. Game 37 V.Korchnoi-L.Portisch Candidates Match, Bad Kissingen 1983, 3rd game English Opening A33 1 c4 c5 2 £>f3 £>c6 3 £ic3 £if6 4 d4 cxd4 5 4}xd4 e6 This well-known opening tabiya has oc¬ curred about fifty times in Korchnoi’s games. 6 £idb5 Viktor Lvovich started out playing 6 JlgS. Then he employed 6 g3, including games from his match with Spassky (1977/78), and in 1988 Karpov played this against him. He also tried 6 Af4 d5 (6...Ab4 7 fodhS) 7 cxd5 <£ixd5 8 ^hxc6 bxc6 9 Ad2, but in the end he gave priority to 6 a3 and with its help he won two important games in his matches with Sax (Wijk aan Zee 1991) and Ponomariov (Do¬ netsk 2001). Indeed, 6 a3!? enables the maximum num¬ ber of pieces to be retained on the board and lengthy forcing lines to be avoided. I too suc¬ cessfully employed this move on one occasion — against Van Wely (Moscow 2004). 6.. .d5! In the Korchnoi-Polugayevsky Candidates match (1980) 6..Jtb4 7 Af4 0-0 was tried, followed by 8 Jtc7 9 Jld6 jtxd6 10 Vxd6 (1st and 5th games) or 8 Jtd6 Jtxd6 9 ^\xd6 (7th, 9th and 13th). By gaining control of the d6-square. White obtains a slight but enduring advantage, which was confirmed by Korchnoi’s wins over Andersson (Johannes¬ burg 1981) and Y.Gruenfeld (Lucerne 1982). 7 Af4! In the event of 7 cxd5 ^xd5 8 ^xd5 (8 e4 4Axc3 9 Wxd8+ ‘sfrxdS 10 ^xc3 AcS is equal) 8.. .exd5 9 Wxd5 Ab4+ 10 Ad2 ±c6 11 tfxd8+ Bxd8 or 10...®e7 (Suba-Portisch, Thessaloniki Olympiad 1984; Ljubojevic- Topalov, Monaco blindfold 1999) Black has excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn. 7.. .e5 8 cxd5 exf4 9 dxc6 bxc6 10 ®xd8+ *xd8 A popular variation at that time. ‘I have devoted many days and nights to the analysis of this position,’ writes Korchnoi. "Working either alone, or with various helpers — Stean, Velimirovic and Gutman — I have spent at least 80 working hours trying to re¬ fute the opinion of theory, that the chances are roughly equal. At first sight, things seem bad for Black. His king is in the centre, and his queenside pawns are weak. But it turns out that White has problems with the develop¬ ment of his kingside, whereas Black can freely 164 Viktor the Terrible develop his forces, at the same time creating threats on the queenside and in the centre. If one casts a brief glance at the position, the first move that comes to mind is 11 0-0-0+, but after ll..Jtd7 the threat of ...4ig4 is very unpleasant. So that, according to theory, the only sensible move for White is 11 Bdl+, but the 80 hours of work at home had not con¬ vinced me of the strength of this theoretical move! After thinking at the board for 20 min¬ utes, I played differently.’ 11 £id4!? For Portisch, who devoutly reveres the theoretical canons, this was an unpleasant sur¬ prise! White abruptly changes the direction of the play: the knight, which usually aims for d6, now attacks the c6-pawn, and the rook, which has remained at al, is ready to support this attack from cl. Korchnoi’s decision is also interesting from the psychological point of view: it is well known that Portisch would often become flustered when there was a sharp change in the situation on the board. In general this is a problem for the majority of players who de¬ vote a lot of time to the study of the opening, they feel very much at home in ‘their’ set-ups, but began to ‘drift’ in unfamiliar positions. Korchnoi keenly sensed the moments when he could advantageously deviate from theory — such a novelty, even though objectively not very strong, had the maximum psychological effect. An ability to vary the character of the play to take account of the individual features of the opponent, which is doubly valuable in matches, was always one of his strong points. Incidentally, in the same match Korchnoi later reverted to the usual line: 11 Bdl+ Jtd7 12 4^d6, and instead of the passive 12...ti?e7?! 13 g3! (Polugayevsky-Gligoric, Bugojno 1982) or the risky 12...Bb8?! 13 £ixf7+ (Andersson- Timman, Bugojno 1982) in the 5th game there followed 12...^c7 13 £kf7 Bg8 14 £ie5 (14 g3 Bb8! Andersson-Tal, 2nd matchgame, Malmo 1983) 14...Bb8 with quite good play for the pawn, and in the 7th — 12...Jtxd6 13 Bxd6 Bb8! 14 b3 (14 Bd2 Be8 15 g3 f3 with equality, Karpov-Polugayevsky, London 1984; H.Olafsson-Portisch, New York 1984) 14.. .5.4 15 g3 (4)e7 16 Bd2 c5 with equality (16...h5!? Kir.Georgiev-Topalov, Sarajevo 2000). 11.. .*c7 A seemingly natural move, but analysts considered the king’s position on the c-file to be dangerous (because of the resource Bel), and since that time Black began playing 11.. Jtd7, as chosen by Timman and Po- lugayevsky against Andersson (Tilburg 1983), or ll..Jtb7, as played by De Firmian and Karpov against Salov (Amsterdam 1996; Dos Hermanas 1997). Thus on the whole the variation with 6...d5! has successfully passed the endurance test. But Korchnoi’s brilliant ‘psychological’ victory remains one of the masterpieces in chess his¬ tory... 12 g3 ±c5?! This strengthens White’s tactical threats along the c-file. 12...jtb4 was safer, ‘followed by ...jtxc3 — in order to block this file,’ (Korchnoi), and if 13 Bel, then 13...Bd8! But 12...Bb8! was even better, and since White cannot get ^way with 13 0-0-0 or 13 <53b3, Korchnoi recommended ‘the sharper continuation 13 Jtg2 Bxb2 14 Bel followed by 0-0 with compensation for the pawn.’ However, in my view, after 14...fxg3 15 hxg3 (15 £kb5+? <4>b6) 15...c5 16 £ia4 (16 £Mb5+? 165 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 4b8) 16..Mxa2 17 ^xc5 jk,xc5 18 2xc5+ <A>d6 19 fic6+ &el or 19 Hg5 Bg8 20 Bh4 h6 the compensation is clearly inadequate. 13 Hcl! (possibly Portisch was expecting 13 4^b3 jkb4 with equality) 13.. .fxg3 This eliminates the threat of gxf4, but, on the other hand, it opens the file for the rook at hi. Korchnoi considers two other possibilities: 1) 13...<S}g4 ‘with the threat of seizing the initiative by ...<5^xf2.’ However, if 14 Jlg2 Black must play 14...Sb8!, since 14...£}xf2? does not work in view of 15 ^cb5+! But Korchnoi was planning the gambit 14 b4!? Jtxb4 15 Jtg2 and 0-0 with somewhat the better chances for White; 2) 13...2b8 (taking control of the b5-square and threatening ...Jtxd4) 14 4^b3 2xb3!? 15 axb3 Analysis diagram At the board White had been intending to play 16 <§M5+ 4^6 17 2xc5 4xc5 18 ^xf4 4b4 19 £k!3+ 4xb3 20 4d2! 2d8 21 4cl ‘with some advantage’, although the position is probably a draw. Later, in analysis at home, Korchnoi ‘dis¬ covered that after 17 2xc5 Black can inter¬ pose the unexpected 17...fxg3!I, threatening by ...£}xf2 and then ...gxh2 to win the other rook,’ and he came to the conclusion that ‘my variation, prepared at the board, would not have worked.’ 18 hxg3?! 4xc5 is indeed weak, but it is better to keep the exchange advantage by 18 Ba5!, when Black faces a struggle for a draw after both 18...gxf2+ 19 4d2 cxd5 20 Jtg2 Jte6 21 h3, and 18...^xf2 19 Jtg2 <5\xhl 20 <Sie3 ^f2 21 hxg3 4ig4 22 4ic4+ 4e6 23 Jtxc6 a6 or 20...Jk,e6 21 jtxhl gxh2. The alternative is 16 Jlg2 jlxf2+ 17 4fl, when ‘Black has no satisfactory retreat for his bishop in view of the knight check at b5 or d5, and on his next move White will play <£M1, retaining a slight material advantage. Hardly a decisive one, however...’ (Korchnoi). Al¬ though, in my opinion, after 17„.fxg3 18 hxg3 JLd7! (but not 18...Axg3 19 itxc6! with the idea of 19...4xc6 20 <S3e4+ and ^xg3) it is hard to talk about any advantage at all for White. 14 hxg3 ±a6? Portisch cracks under the strain! Yet he only needed to play 14...2b8, in order after 15 4^b3 (nothing is achieved by 15 4M5+ 4d6 16 £M6 jtxd4 17 ^e4+ 4c7) 15..Jtb4 16 jtg2 Jtd7, in the words of Korchnoi, ‘to safe¬ guard himself against White’s threats and set up a long-term defence.’ Summing up the impressions of Black’s llth-14th moves (the critical phase of the game), it can he stated that he missed several safer continuations, and also some sharper ones, exploiting the dynamic features of the position — such as the presence of the pawn at f4 and the possibility of attacking the f2- and b2-pawns. However, the only move that genu¬ inely deserves to be criticised is the ‘careless’, 166 as Korchnoi defined it, 14th, after which Black’s position collapses literally like a house of cards. 15 £}xc6! This unexpected move wins the game. And effectively, not only this game, but also the entire match! Indeed, Portisch was unable to recover from this blow and he lost the match 6-3!’ (Korchnoi) 15.. .1tb7 (or 15...4xc6 16 ^a4 with an irre¬ sistible attack, in which the decisive role is played by the inclusion of the rook from hi) 16 ®a4! All the same! ‘Of course, not 16 JLg2? Jtxc6 17 Jtxc6 Jtxf2+ and Black regains the pawn,’ (Korchnoi), although even here after 18 <4?xf2 £lg4+ 19 4g2 4xc6 20 Hh5! White would have retained the initiative. 16.. .±xf2+ ‘If 16...Jlxc6 17 Hxc5 4d6 18 flxc6+ 4xc6 19 ±g2+ 4d6 20 ±xa8 Bxa8 21 Hh4, and the win for White should not present any great difficulty.’ (Korchnoi) 17 4xf2 ^e4+ 17... Jtxc6 was also hopeless: 18 Jtg2 £}g4+ 19 4gl £\e5 20 fih5! (using all the space of the chessboard) 20...4d6 21 fidl+ 4c7 22 fixeS jtxa4 23 fid4 Hae8 24 fla5 (Korchnoi), or more quickly — 23 Se7+ 4b6 24 fib7+ 4a6 25 Hd6+. 18 4g1 White could have won quite simply by 18 4e3 Jlxc6 19 Jlg2 (as well as 19 Bxc6+ 4xc6 Viktor the Terrible 20 4xe4) 19...6 (19...fiae8 20 flxcftf) 20 Hhfl Hhf8 (20...g6 21 ±xe4 &e4 22 Hf6) 21 Bxc6+ 4xc6 22 Sxf5 flxf5 23 itxe4+ fld5 24 £}c3 — pretty geometry! However, the retreat to gl does not spoil anything. 18.. Jbcc6 Black has temporarily restored material equality, but after the following obvious move further losses for him are inevitable. 19 ±$2 2ae8 (if 19...f5, then 20 g4 g6 21 gxf5 gxf5 22 Bh6, winning the bishop) 20 Eh4!f5 21g4! Precise geometrical motifs. As in many other games of his mature and later period, Korchnoi displays an excellent vision of the board. 21-«4 Or 21...4d6 22 Hxc6+ 4xc6 23 gxf5 4b5 24 ±xe4 4xa4 25 ±c6+ 4a5 26 ±xe8 Bxe8 27 Hxh7 and wins (Korchnoi). 167 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 22 Bxc6+!

(with the threat of Be7-e4+) SI-.^eB 32 Hxa7 Bd2 33 £ic5 Sbd4 34 Sa6 Hd6 35 2a5! 1-0 In the 4th game Portisch tried his utmost to draw level, and on the 33rd move he sacrificed the exchange, but in a sharp time scramble Korchnoi seized the initiative and immediately after the time control he built up an irresistible attack on the king. The score became 3Vi-Vi! The outcome of the 10-game match was de¬ cided. In the semi-final Korchnoi was drawn against me. In my preparations I quickly estab¬ lished that my opponent was still at the cutting-edge of chess thinking, laying the main paths in the development of opening theory and generating new, original ideas or substantially refining old ones. This was also shown by our match. Initially it was due to take place in the late summer in Pasadena. The intrigues which led to its collapse on account of my non- appearance, and those amazing events thanks to which the match nevertheless took place, are something that I will describe in Volume 7 (since this relates more to my struggle with Karpov). It could all have turned out differ¬ ently, had not Korchnoi taken the noble deci¬ sion to play the semi-final match, but ex¬ ploited his formal right to go through to the final. However, he demonstrated in fact that his criticisms of the ‘paper’ championship were no empty words. In September Viktor Lvovich arrived in Niksic in Yugoslavia, at the very time when I was successfully concluding a super- toumament there. Discussions about the match, sanctioned by Moscow, were initially made through an intermediary and proceeded with great difficulty. But the deadlock was bro¬ ken when it was finally promised to Korchnoi that his main and lawful demand would be met — the termination of the boycott by Soviet play¬ ers. As far as I am aware, an active role in these negotiations was played by two journalists: on the one side — Alexander Roshal, and on the other — the Yugoslav Brana Zmcevic. The repairing of our personal relations was helped by the blitz tournament in Herceg Novi, organised immediately after Niksic. I won this double-round event of nine grandmasters (13Vi out of 16), twice beating Korchnoi, who took second place (IOV2). Possibly he was impressed by the fact that I played in the same tourna¬ ment as him, despite the negotiations not being completed. For him this blitz event was the first breakthrough of the seven-year blockade! Several times we were able to talk openly about the forthcoming match, which we were both impatiently awaiting. And soon our 12-game match became a re¬ ality (London, November-December 1983). The atmosphere surrounding it proved far calmer than expected. My relations with Korchnoi were normal. I realised that, despite the enormous age difference (32 years), he was a very dangerous opponent, with a mastery of numerous chess procedures. I knew that I must not allow him to dictate the play in sim¬ ple and technical positions, and in my prepara¬ tions I devoted particular attention to a study of practical endings. In the match this was repaid with interest! However, in the 1st game I lost ignomini- ously — this game, apparently for ever, has remained my only defeat against Korchnoi. 168 Viktor the Terrible Game 38 G. Kasparov-V. Korchnoi Candidates Match, London 1983,1st game Queen’s Indian Defence El2 1 d4 £)f6 2 c4 e6 3 £)f3 b6 (in those years Korchnoi more often replied 3.. Jtb4+) 4 *hc3 Ab7 5 a3 This move could have been expected: I used to play this regularly and very success¬ fully. But in my opponent’s games the posi¬ tion had occurred only two or three times. 5...d5 6 cxd5 £>xd5 7 e3 The more dynamic continuation 7 Wc2 has been described in the notes to the Petrosian- Smyslov game (Volume 3, Game No. 14). I should add 7...£\xc3 8 bxc3 Ae7 9 e4 0-0 10 ±d3 c5 11 0-0 ®c7 12 We2 £ld7 13 ±b2 flac8 14 £\d2 fifd8 15 flfdl £\£6 with ap¬ proximate equality (Kasparov-Kramnik, Linares 2004). 7.. .g6! A surprise! The usual line at that time was 7.. Jte7 8 Jtb5+ c6 9 Jtd3 (Volume 3} Game Nos. 14 and 45). The new move 7...g6 was al¬ ready known (it had been played by Short and Adorjan), but before this I had not studied it seriously. And I gave insufficient attention to the five-minute game Tal-Korchnoi (Herceg Novi 1983), which went 7...£}xc3 8 bxc3 g6. The reply of my highly experienced oppo¬ nent abruptly changes the pattern of the posi¬ tion: it leads to a kind of Griinfeld Defence, which was part of Korchnoi’s armoury long before I was bom (Game No.2). Now it is hard for White to build up a combined attack in the centre and on the kingside (which is precisely what I had been very successful with!), and he h2s to seek other paths. Korchnoi keenly sensed that I would become nervous — espe¬ cially in the first game of the match — and that I would lose my aim. More than that: the ef¬ fect of the surprise proved stunning! 8 ±b5+ Polugayevsky-Korchnoi (1st matchgame, London 1984) went 8 h4!P ±g7 9 h5 c5P! 10 Ab5+ ±c6 11 ±d3 £M7 12 e4 £kc3 13 bxc3 Wc7 14 Jtg5! with an obvious advantage to White, but 9...£M7 was safer. Another line goes 8 4^xd5 exd5 (not so solid is 8...Wxd5 9 Wc2 Timman-Short, Lon¬ don 1982; Kramnik-Korchnoi, Monaco blind¬ fold 1994) 9 ±b5+ c6 10 ±d3 Ag7 11 e4 dxe4 12 ±xe4 Aa6 13 AgS £6!? 14 Ae3 0-0 15 Wb3+ <i?h8 16 0-0-0 £5 with an unclear game (Atalik-Korchnoi, Manila Olympiad 1992) or 11 b4 0-0 12 ±d2 £>d7 13 Ibl Se8 14 0-0 ^f6 with equality (Kasparov-Kramnik, internet blitz 2001). 8.. .c6 9 J.d3 At the first attempt I played by analogy with the 7„.jLe7 variation, and at the second, against Timman (Amsterdam 1991) — 9 Jk,a4 JLg7 10 e41? (instead of the usual 10 0-0 0-0 II e4 4^xc3 12 bxc3 c5 13 Jtg5 Wd6 with equality, Kupreichik-Makarichev, Kiev 1984; Radjabov-Karpov, Moscow rapidplay 2002) 10.. .^xc3 11 bxc3, and after ll...jta6!P 12 h4 Wc7 13 e5 £>d7 14 JkM h6 15 I'd 0-0-0 16 We3 c5 17 ^d2 sl?b8 a sharp battle devel¬ oped, leading in the end to a draw. 9.. .1.g7 10 e4 White gains no advantage with 10 0-0 0-0 11 £}xd5 cxd5 (Tarjan-Adorjan, Vrsac 1983). From the mid-1990s, to play e3-e4 without allowing the exchange on c3, they began play¬ ing 10 £}e2P! (after which 10...c5! is strong) or 169 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 10 £k4. But it doubtful whether Black's de¬ fences can be shaken in this way, as has been demonstrated in practice by Karpov, Short, Grischuk and Kramnik 10...^xc3 11 bxc3 11.. .C5! A new, more energetic move than 11...0-0 (Ftacnik-Adorjan, Banja Luka 1983). Black's fianchettoed bishops strike with great force at the opponent's centre — an excellent version of the ‘Griinfeld’! 12 Ag5 It is pleasant to develop a piece with gain of tempo, but 12 Jlb5+ Jtc6 13 Jtxc6+ 4ixc6 14 Jte3 (Ftacnik) or 12 Jte3 0-0 13 0-0 was safer. 12.. .#d6! Black does not want to relieve the pressure on d4, rightly assuming that the win of a fur¬ ther tempo will not bring White any benefits. 13 e5 (sooner or later it is impossible to get by without e4-e5) 13...tfd7 13...1tfd5 was also possible, but Korchnoi wanted to provoke me into making the fol¬ lowing reply. 14 dxc5? ‘This move is hard to understand.’ (Korch¬ noi). And indeed, was it worth voluntarily breaking up my pawn centre, when after the simple 14 0-0 0-0 15 1§e2 cxd4 16 cxd4 ^c6 17 We3 or 17 Jte4 White would not have been threatened with any danger? But I was already thinking of rapidly relieving the situa¬ tion, and, as often happened with me at the time, I underestimated the dynamic factors of the position... 14.. .0-0! (but not 14...bxc5 15 Jtb5! Jtc6 16 a4, and only Black may have problems) 15 cxb6 axb6 16 0-0 Wc 7 Immediately taking aim at the c3- and e5- pawns and preparing to bring out the knight. After the hasty 16...£Ic6? 17 Ae4 Wc7 18 ±£6! Axfi6 19 exf6 Wf4 20 Ifbl (20 Wd7!? Dvoretsky) White would have seized the ini¬ tiative. ‘For the pawn Black has gained pressure on White's weaknesses and a successful devel¬ opment of his pieces. It is clear that White cannot hold on to his material advantage. But will he be able to disrupt Black's harmonious development?' (Korchnoi) 17 ±b5!? White sharply changes the character of the play: immediately giving up the important e5- pawn, he tries to exploit the activity of his pieces and Black’s momentary lag in develop¬ ment. Initially I had been planning 17 Bel with the possible sequel 17...£fc6 18 Jte4 BaS 19 Jlf6 or 17...ttxc3 18 ±e7 Be8 19 Ab4, but on closer examination I discovered an inter¬ esting exchange sacrifice for Black — 17...^d7! 18 Jle7 (18 jtf4 Bfd8 is too cheerless) 18.. .±x£3! (18...<£>xe5 19 AxfB ^x£3+20 gxf3 BxfS 21 jLe4 is not so clear) 19 gxf3 (19 ®xf3?! ^ixe5 20 Bxe5 Jtxe5 21 Jtxf8 BxfS, winning a pawn) 19...jtxe5 20 Jtxf8 ilxh2+ 170 Viktor the Terrible 21 <4)g2 Bxf8, and White faces an extremely unpleasant defence. By this point I had already used more than two hours, whereas Korchnoi’s first 15 moves had taken him only four® minutes. True, on his next move he spent about 50 minutes... 17.. Jtxe5! This reply, exploiting the undefended state of the bishops at b5 and g5, sets White the greatest problems. 17..JLxf3P! 18 ^xQ Ba5 19 a4 ±xe5 20 g3 Wxc3 21 ttxc3 ±xc3 22 Sadi (Korchnoi) or 22 Sacl! (Dvoretsky) is clearly to White’s advantage. Let us also con¬ sider quiet development: 1) 17...£k6 18 lfd6 jtxeS 19 Wxc7 ±xc7 20 Bfdl and Black’s advantage is merely sym¬ bolic, or 18 A£61? £ke5 19 ^xe5 ±xf6 20 ?hd7 (Korchnoi) 20,..^.xc3 21 <S3xf8 (Dvoret¬ sky also suggests the unclear 21 Bel) 21.. .Axal 22 4ixe6 with equality; 2) 17...£k6 18 Af6 ±x£6 19 exf6 #xc3 20 Vd4 ®xd4 21 £)xd4 ^hcl 22 Bfbl with equality (Korchnoi), or 18 a4 Jtxf3 19 ®xf3 Jtxe5 20 g3 Wxc3 21 Wxc3 Jhtc3 22 Bad with full compensation for the sacrificed pawn. 18 Jth6 (of course, not 18 £lxe5? ®xe5 19 ±h6 ®xb5 20 Wd4 e5 and wins) 18...±g7?! Having obtained a permanently better pawn structure, Korchnoi wants to avoid any lack of clarity and to decide the outcome with the help of simplification and purely technical means (as it later transpired, this was the corner-stone of his match strategy). 18...Bd8! suggests itself, although this would have allowed a queen sacrifice — 19 ^ixeSP! Bxdl 20 Baxdl, and if 20...f6P, then 21 £id7! ^ixd7 22 Ixd7 Wc5 23 Bg7+! <i>h8 24 lxb7 Wxb5 25 Ag7+ 4>g8 26 Axf6 with sufficient counterplay. Even so, after 20...£k:6 21 ^e5! 22 4£if6+ iihb (Dvoretsky) or 20.. JLc6!? Black could have parried the oppo¬ nent’s threats and gradually converted his ma¬ terial advantage. Probably, all that remained for White was the patient 19 We2, for example: 19...^.xf3 20 WxB Ba5 21 a4 ±xh2+ 22 *hl Bd5 23 g4! JLe5 24 Badl with good compensation for the pawn, or 19..Jtg7 20 j^xg7 <4>xg7 21 We3 Axf3 22 Wxf3 £>a6 23 Jtxa6! Bxa6 24 Bfbl with an inferior but defensible position. 19±xg7 *xg7 After the exchange of the dark-squared bishops White has gained an opportunity to create counterplay on the weakened dark squares. 20 »d4+ *g8 In the event of 20...f6P! 21 <$3g5 We7 (21...®c8? 22 Bael e5 23 Bxe5! and wins — Korchnoi) 22 Bael e5 23 f4 Black would have defended by 23...<53c6 24 Wxb6 fxg5 (Dvoret¬ sky) or 23...<S3a6!P 24 <S3f3 (24 fxe5 fxg5 25 e6+ ih6 is insufficient) 24...e4 etc. But after 22 ^h3! (this move is also recommended by Dvoretsky) White, who is threatening Wxb6, would have retained some advantage. At any event, a further weakening of his king’s defences was not at all to Korchnoi’s taste. 21 £ig5? The choice of this incorrect route for the knight fully justifies Black’s avoidance of complications three moves earlier. Only centralisation by 21 4£ie5!, which in¬ volves a piece sacrifice, would have given an attack sufficient for at least a draw: 21...Bd8! (21...f6P 22 £>c4 or 21...1a5 22 c4 £ic6 23 ixc6 Jtxc6 24 f4 is less good - Korchnoi) 22 ®h4! Bd5 23 £}g4 Sxb5! 24 Badl!

After 23...£M7 White would have been saved by the double attack 24 Jtxd7 Hhtd7 25 ®e3, whereas now he has to choose the lesser of two evils. 24 #e3?! Again a weak move. The black knight clearly has better prospects than the white bishop, and after 24 Jtxa6! flxa6 25 tte3 ‘Black’s advantage would have been merely theoretical’ (Korchnoi). At the board I did not like 25...flfa8!

But now things are far more difficult for White, since Black, by retaining his knight, obtains additional possibilities of fighting for an advantage. In such a situation it is easy to slip up, especially when feeling grieved by the unsuccessful outcome of the opening. 25 Wxc5 Alas, this is forced: 25 ®e2 ^hc7 is bad for White, as is 25 JLxa6 Wxe3 26 fxe3 flxa6 — because of the appearance of a third weakness (the e3-pawn) White has a very difficult rook endgame. 25.. .£ixc5 26 Hfbl Hfd8 27 ±f1?!

However, four successive draws brought me back to normal, and the turning point came in the 6th game. It was adjourned in an unclear, but probably drawn position. On the resumption, attempting to sharpen the play, Korchnoi chose a continua¬ tion that was not the best, and on the 57th move a prosaic rook endgame arose, where White had to display a certain accuracy to gain a draw. Korchnoi needed to find an advanta¬ geous way'of giving up his rook for a passed pawn, but he transposed moves, missing an intermediate check, and his position became hopeless. In the end I won 7-4 (+4-1=6). In an in¬ terview after the match Korchnoi admitted: ‘After the 6th game I lost faith in my tech¬ nique and my seconds. The scores became equal, but psychologically the match was most. My pre-match impression of Kasparov, as a player of a single knock-out blow, was faulty. Kasparov is a highly technical player for his age. He goes in for a risk only when he is con¬ fident that such a step is justified.’ Certain western commentators suggested that I should express my gratitude to Korchnoi, for the fact that he accelerated by chess maturity and helped me to grasp the subdeties of positional play. Indeed, the bene¬ fit from this match is hard to overestimate. Thus at the end of 1983 the ‘perpetual’ challenger essentially said farewell to his dream of becoming world champion. In the Candidates tournament of the next cycle (Montpellier 1985) he finished well behind the leaders, although he continued to win or share first places in other tournaments: in 1984 174 Viktor the Terrible there was Wijk aan Zee, Beersheva, Sarajevo and a win against Polugayevsky on board three in the second USSR-Rest of the World match, in 1985 — Tilburg, Lucerne (board one in the Wodd Team Championship) and Brussels... Against the King's Indian Even in the later period of his career, playing up to 150 games in a year, Korchnoi has con¬ tinued to readjust and harmonise his style. As he himself writes: ‘My games with Panno (1985), Amason (1987) and Pinter (1988) are an object of pride for me, a demonstration of victory of character over harmful habits.’ In¬ deed, Korchnoi began fighting more keenly for the initiative with White, which in combi¬ nation with his fine technique gave him excel¬ lent results. Very typical is the introduction to his game with Seirawan (Lugano 1986): In his time Mikhail Botvinnik advised masters and grandmasters to plan their opening repertoire, such that they would not have to battle against their own opening systems. Botvinnik, it is true, played not more than 50 games in a year, and it was comparatively easy for him to fol¬ low his own advice. At the end of the 20th century, chess life has become more intensive. The number of top-class grandmasters has grown — not like in Botvinnik’s time, when there were just a few. There are now players who, after making a thorough study of some opening, happily play it for both sides... For a long time I tried to follow Botvinnik’s advice. But on one occasion I grew bold. It happened like this. During a tournament I began prepar¬ ing for a game with Boris Spassky where I would be Black. I carefully studied how he played the Closed Variation of the Sicilian. His handling of this position impressed me. In my attempts to refute his strategy I was unsuc¬ cessful — I drew that game with difficulty. But with the knowledge gained, I myself decided to try playing like Spassky. Since I rarely play 1 e4, I decided to employ his ideas against 1 c4 devotees. It is true that Black is a tempo down, but this did not concern me. I defeated in succession Seirawan, Suba and Karls son. “And now,” I decided, “having gained this experience playing Black, why not play this position as White!?” ’ There followed 1 c4 e5 2 g3 3 iLg2 g6 4 £>c3 &g7 5 d3 d6 6 Sbl f5 7 b4 £tf6 &b5 £te7 9 ®b3!? h6 10 e3 0-0 11 £>ge2 s£?h7 12 a4 2b8 13 ±a3 &c6 14 0-0 g5 15 d4!, and White, after seizing the initiative, ultimately gained a spectacular win. Thus over a period of four months Korchnoi defeated Seirawan in this set-up both with Black (Montpellier Candidates 1985) and with White (Lugano 1986). In the preceding chapters you have been able to acquaint yourself with Korchnoi’s opening repertoire as Black. It is curious that, among his variety of replies to 1 d4, he has hardly ever played the King’s Indian Defence — seemingly an ideal weapon for a player of counterattacking style. Evidently, as a fervent ‘GrunfekT player, he did not like shutting in his bishop at g7. On the contrary, all his life he has happily played against the King’s Indian as White, employing virtually all the variations: with the development of the bishop at g2, and the Samisch, and the classical with 4}f3 and &e2. Korchnoi’s plans have always been deeply thought out He has made an especially great contribution to the reassessment of the Tai- manov variation with 10 JLe3, which was bur¬ ied in 1953 and revived in 1987. From genera¬ tion to generation a stereotype was passed on, even captivating Fischer: ‘Black’s kingside at¬ tack has practically been worked out to a forced mate!’ However, thanks to Korchnoi, everyone began looking differently at the po¬ tential of these positions. It turned out that White is not so defenceless on the kingside and that he has interesting offensive possibili¬ ties on the queenside. The first game on this theme, played in the Interzonal tournament (Zagreb 1987), re¬ sounded like thunder from a clear sky. It 175 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors dearly expresses Korchnoi’s eternal striving to search for unexpected, original paths. Not without reason was it judged to be the most important theoretical game of Informator Vol¬ ume 44.

Mutual flank storms are in prospect, with Black’s attack looking the more dangerous: he has the white king in his sights! And the aforementioned games ended in disaster for White. But Korchnoi has his own conception, reflecting his inherent optimism: Tflack is ad- vandng his pawns away from his king, leaving it completely without protection. If the oppo¬ nent does not flinch, if the attack will be re¬ pulsed, the checkmating of the bare black king will begin. That is what in fact happened in many games that I have played with this varia¬ tion.’ 13 ^b5!? An uncommonly paradoxical move in a po¬ sition which had seemingly been exhaustively studied. However, it involves a sound strategic idea: by ^\a7xc8 to eliminate the opponent’s powerful bishop and sharply reduce the effect of the ...g5-g4 breakthrough. Soon an acceptable defence was found for Black, and then Viktor Lvovich introduced 13 a4!? (regarding the previous moves 13 ^d3 and 13 b4 - cf.

But since 1996, considering the attacking re¬ sources of 13 a4 to be exhausted, Korchnoi switched to the no less complicated 13 ficl, with the idea of 13...£}g6 14 c5! <?3xc5 15 b4 fta6 16 £M3 (16 ^hb5 JLd7 17 Zhxal is un¬ clear, Korchnoi-M.Ivanov, Enghien les Bains 1997) 16„.h5 17 £lb5 ±dl 18 a4 ±h6 19 fic3, as in the games Piket-Kasparov (Linares 1997) and Korchnoi-Cvitan, Pula 1997). 13.. .a6?! Subsequently, players with Black employed both the gambit idea 13...£if6!? 14 £\xa7 Jtd7 (Benjamin-Nunn, Hastings 1987/88), and also the sound 13...b6! 14 b4 (14 a4 a6 15 ^c3 a5!) 14.. .a6 15 ^c3 (15 £ia3?! h5 Khuzman- Smirin, Sverdlovsk 1987) 15...£}g6, 15...£if6 16 c5 flb8, or 15...h5 (Korchnoi-Ye Jiang- chuan, Novi Sad Olympiad 1990), and in gen¬ eral they were able to neutralise 13 £ib5. 14 &a7! (of course!) 14...fixa7?! On encountering an incredible innovatory idea of his opponent, Hulak tries to refute it — by trapping the bishop. But everything has been anticipated by White! Evidently 14...^f6 (Korchnoi) 15 4lxc8 Bxc8 16 c5 g4 was bet¬ ter, although it is hard for Black to count on any real attack without the c8-bishop. 15 ±xa7 b6 16 b4!

Now, however, it turns out that the bishop at a7, although cut off, is still alive. And White, exploiting this factor, succeeds in breaking up the opponent’s queenside. My trainers and I looked at this position back in 1988, when I was regularly playing the King’s Indian Defence, and we came to the conclu¬ sion that Black shouldn’t play this. 16.. .±b7 With the threat of ...®a8 or ...^c8. 16...c5? does not work on account of 17 dxc6 £\xc6 18 Wd5+, while after 16...£>f6 17 c5 g4 18 ficl or 16...£\g6 17 £id3 £tf6 18 c5 White gets his attack in first. 17 c5!

Korchnoi — 11 out of 16; 2-3. Ehlvest and Seirawan — 10, ahead of Nikolic, Torre, Po- lugayevsky, Miles... And early in the same year 1987 Korchnoi shared 1st place with Short in Wijk aan Zee, establishing a record for the 178 Viktor the Terrible number of victories (four!) in this prestigious traditional tournament His subsequent attempts to ‘refute’ the King’s Indian Defence were also very success¬ ful: after the game with Hulak he gained a number of striking wins in the variation with 13 a4!? Here his only failure over a period of eight years was his game with me in Amster¬ dam (1991). A year later we again clashed in a King’s Indian at the European Team Champi¬ onship in Debrecen, and I only escaped by the skin of my teeth. And soon Korchnoi tried to improve White’s play in a game with Shirov. Game 40 V.Korchnoi-A.

The knight defends the c7-square against the invasion of the white pieces, which reduces the effectiveness of the standard plan with 10 £}d3 and c4-c5. However, White has other possibilities. 10 &e3 Of course, Korchnoi is not satisfied with the comparatively safe — but also inoffensive! — continuation 10 ^d3 f5 11 f4 (Petrosian- Tal, Bled 1961). 10.. .f5 11 f3 f4 11...c5 (Game No.4T) is another idea.

But after 24 h3 White does indeed have quite a good position. 24 Ixc8 Hxc8 25 ®xc8 ®xc8 Shirov could have eliminated one of the opponent’s powerful bishops — 25...®xf2 26 Hxf2 Wxc8.

That same year, taking part in the Dutch Team Championship, Korchnoi also im¬ proved White’s play in another branch of this sharp variation of the King’s Indian. In his game with Nijboer he was able to carry out the same destructive piece sacrifice with the aim of creating a pawn avalanche, as once made previously by Tal (Volume 2, Game No. 133) and Spassky (Volume 3, Game No.77). Game 41 V.Korchnoi-F.

However, both practice, and my own King's Indian ex¬ perience, suggest that usually this move is in¬ sufficient* Black loses time, and all the same he is unable to block the flank completely. 12 £kJ3! Not long before this, against the same op¬ ponent in Wijk aan Zee (1993), Korchnoi had chosen 12 dxc6 bxc6 13 ttfd2 (13 c5P! d5) 13..

Korchnoi is terribly critical of this move, regarding it as the reason for Black’s crushing defeat in this game, and adding: The trouble is that this move was recommended in a simi¬ lar position by the world champion Kasparov!’ However, I recommended ...h7-h5 in a dif¬ ferent position (cf. the note to Black’s 12th move in Game NoAO). In such complicated, double-edged set-ups all the distinctions must be keenly felt. Here I would have preferred 13.. .g5 — every tempo is precious to Black, and now 14 g4 is no longer dangerous for him, since he has succeeded in ‘freezing’ the queen- side. And for White, if he is aiming for the piece sacrifice, playing g2-g4 is inconvenient for him. There could have followed 14 b4 b6 15 a4 a5 16 bxc5 bxc5 17 flbl £\g6, and in the variations with 18 £ixc5, instead of the unnecessary move ...h7-h5 Black has made the far more useful ...^g6. It is such nuances that comprise the differ¬ ence in the understanding of this or that posi¬ tion. Nijboer thought that he had erected a fortress, but in fact this proves to be an illusion. 14 b4 (it is essential to open the b-file) 14...b6 15 a4 a5 16 bxc5 bxc5 ‘After 16...dxc5 Black is left with two pawn weaknesses — at b6 and e5, but on the other hand he obtains a good square for his knight — d6. If is true that ....dxc5 might not have af¬ fected the course of the present game.’ (Korchnoi) 17 Sbl g5 Launching a counter-offensive, in a seem- ingly solid position. But Korchnoi points out that, out of his first 17 moves. Black has made 11 with his pawns and he has advanced all eight of them! Whereas his pieces are all hud¬ dled together on the 7th and 8th ranks... 18^xc5! This came as a surprise to my opponent, as, however, did many of my other moves in this game,’ Korchnoi remarks with satisfac¬ tion. ‘The unhurried 18 Wb3 was possible, also with a solid advantage to White.’ And if 18.. .^g6, then 19 ®b6. But the knight sacri¬ fice is far more effective! 18.. .dxc5 19 JLxc5 £ig6?! In Korchnoi’s opinion, T9..,Bf6 was cor¬ rect, defending the b6-square, and intending to post the rook at g6 and the bishop at f8. After 20 th3 AfS 21 Af2 g4 22 c5 <&>h7 23 d6 White has excellent compensation for the sacrificed piece, but there is still a serious bat¬ tle in prospect.’ 183 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors However, 21 JLb6! is stronger, forcing 21.. .Hxb6 (otherwise 22 c5!) 22 Wxb6 Wxb6+ 23 fixb6, and after 23...^£5 (23...£ixd5?! 24 £>xd5 and wins) 24 Sg6+ ^ifg7 25 fixgS White has a rook and three pawns for two minor pieces and every chance of winning.

Nevertheless, Korchnoi considers the King’s Indian Defence to be ‘quite a flexible opening’, only in the Classical Variation he does not approve of 7...£k6: ‘It is surprising that so many top players choose the least flexible move, leading to sharp play with at¬ tacks on opposite sides. A quiet, strategic bat¬ tle results after 7...4ibd7, 7...£la6 or 7...exd4.’ Well, we will see what the consequences of the ‘quiet’ 7...^bd7 can be (Game No AT). As fifty years of practice have shown, the move 7.. .^c6 is not really so ‘inflexible’, and Korchnoi’s categorical evaluation is a reflec¬ tion more of his natural maximalism. Inciden¬ tally, Eduard Gufeld, a well-known advocate of the King’s Indian Defence, stated categori¬ cally that, on the contrary, in all three of its main variations (with 3 g3, 5 £3 and 5 ^f3, JLe2 and 0-0) Black should develop his queen’s knight only at c6, since this is the sole way of gaining sufficient counterplay! Strict Examiner During his long chess career, Korchnoi, as he himself has said, has had to meet with representatives of at least six generations at the board. Moreover, against the young he has al¬ ways played with some kind of special fervour, in a very interesting creative manner. And even grandmasters among the top ten in the world have very often been unable to find an effective antidote to his deep and unusual ideas. 184 Viktor the Terrible His forte still remained new, unexpected and energetic continuations, sharply changing the situation on the board. Often his oppo¬ nents were simply unable to find their bear¬ ings, although traditionally it is considered that the young brain should react more quickly to any changes. But even in his advancing years Korchnoi has not lost his freshness of percep¬ tion. Sudden changes of scene do not frighten him — he himself aims for them! Even now an uneven chess tempo is his natural element1 Plus, as has already been mentioned, excep¬ tionally fine technique and positional under¬ standing. Therefore his games with young players, keeping in mind their strength and potential, are especially important and instruc¬ tive. I will begin with the double-round tourna¬ ment of eight grandmasters in Tilburg (1989), a memorable one for me. The oldest contest¬ ant was the 58-year-old Viktor Korchnoi, and the youngest — the 20-year-old Ukrainian grandmaster Vasily Ivanchuk, who was then already rated No.3 in the world. Ivanchuk’s enormous talent was obvious: Botvinnik even predicted victory for him in Tilburg, despite the participation of the world champion! Ini¬ tially Vasily justified these hopes: at the start, like Korchnoi and I, he scored 3 out of 4, gaining a draw with Black against Korchnoi. In the 5th round I managed to beat Ivanchuk — but Korchnoi also won his game! Neverthe¬ less, by gaining five successive wins, I pulled away from my rival, and in the second half of the tournament there was only a fight for 2nd place. After his loss to me, Ivanchuk tried desper¬ ately but unsuccessfully to improve his tour¬ nament position. And his game from the sec¬ ond half with Korchnoi was virtually his last chance of finishing in the first three. It should be said that Vasily has always been distin¬ guished by his serious approach to the game: he could play anything at all, but he tried to choose openings specially for his particular opponents. However, here he met his match! Game 42 V.lvanchuk-V.Korchnoi Tilburg 1989 Catalan Opening E04 1 d4 £rf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 Not Ivanchuk’s main weapon. Possibly he chose the Catalan under the influence of the Kasparov-Korchnoi match (1983), where Black lost V2-2V2 in this opening. If Vasily was hoping that his opponent would still have an unpleasant aftertaste, this psychological ploy proved unjustified. 3...d5 4 itg2 dxc4 5 4&f3 (after the quiet 5 ®a4+ £ibd7 White regains the pawn, but usu¬ ally loses his opening initiative) 5.. .£}c6!? A rare variation at that time — although af¬ ter this game it gained momentum! 5...a6 used to be very popular, while in his match with me Korchnoi tried 5...c5, and 5...JLd7, and 5.„£ibd7. 6 ®a4 (6 0-0 a6 or 6...flb8 Kir.Georgiev- Korchnoi, Biel 1992) 6...!,b4+ 7 ±d2 ^d5 (7..JLd6!? 8 0-0 0-0 9 Wxc4 e5 Karpov- Kramnik, Wijk aan Zee 1998) 8 iixb4 8 Wb5 is more rarely played, in order after 8.. .0.0 to regain the pawn — 9 ®xc4, and after 8.. .Jlxd2+ 9 ^bxd2 c3 10 bxc3 £ixc3 11 Wd3 £id5 12 0-0 0-0 followed by e2-e4 to obtain quite good compensation for it. 8.. .£>dxb4 9 a3 "Theory considers 9 0-0 JSb8 10 4^c3 a6 11 185 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors £te5 to be more prudent, but some players, and they indude Ivanchuk, do not seek safety in chess!’ (Korchnoi) 9.. .b5! 10#xb5 In the event of 10 Wdl <Sid5 Black has a perfecdy sound position with an extra pawn: 11 e4 (11 a4 b4) ll...<Slb6 12 £k3 a6 13 0-0 0-0 14 ®d2 <kbl 15 fladl We7 16 h4 ladB (Karpov-Kramnik, Monaco blindfold 1999). 10.. .£ic2+ 11 s£?d2 After the newly fashionable 11 ^fl Jld7! 12 Sa2 £>6xd4 13 WcS Wz7 or 13...&E!?

An excellent novelty, opening up a whole new line in the theory of the Catalan. The old game Aizenshtadt-Taimanov (Leningrad 1949) went 13...ffb8 14 b4 c5 15 ^c3 cxd4 16 4^e4 JLb5 17 #a2 d3! with the initiative for Black (18 Hxal fic8!), but Taimanov suggested 15 Wc3\ cxb4 16 axb4 a5 17 Ifxal axb4 18 Icl, when White’s two knights outweigh the rook, despite the strong passed b-pawn. Since that time the variation 5...^c6 had been shelved. Korchnoi gives an interesting explanation for the origin of the move 13...c5: 'One of the greatest experts on the Catalan Opening for White in the 1970s and 1980s was grandmas¬ ter Genna Sosonko. Once I noticed that with Black he was aiming to obtain this position. He had thought up something! But what? His opponents avoided the critical position. I spent several hours at home looking at this variation and found an improvement for Black!’ 14#a2 Essentially the only move. The alternatives are bad for White: 14 ^c3? #b6! (this move, given by Korchnoi in Informaton; is more ag¬ gressive than 14...cxd4 15 £tecd4 2c8 16 Wd3 e5), or 14 4^e5? flc8 15 d5 2b8! 14.. .#35+ 15 b4? In an unfamiliar and suddenly sharpened situation. White makes a serious mistake. Ap¬ parently the opponent’s novelty had left Ivan¬ chuk in a state of shock.

(17 e3 e5 18 b4 #a6 or my suggestion — 19 &d5 i.e6!) 17...e5 18 b41§b6 19 £lc2, and this became the main line of the entire variation.

I played Adams in the last round, and I was 186 Viktor the Terrible a point ahead of Anand and Kramnik. My colleagues smiled: is this really the way to play the opening, when you only need a draw? However, I sensed that White had some ad¬ vantage and I wanted to play this complicated position. But then I realised that I had com¬ mitted an inaccuracy and I offered a draw...

Thanks to this win, Viktor Lvovich firmly established himself in 2nd place — and he maintained it to the end of the tournament: 1. Kasparov — 12 out of 14; 2. Korchnoi — 8V2; 3. Sax — 7; 4-5. Ivanchuk and Ljubojevic — 6V2, etc. The Interzonal tournament of the next cy¬ cle, held for the first time on the Swiss system (Manila, summer 1990), was marked by the resolute emergence into the arena of the gen¬ eration of 20-year-olds, although some experi¬ enced fighters also qualified for the Candi¬ dates: 1-2. Gelfand and Ivanchuk — 9 out of 13; 3-4. Anand and Short - 8V2; 5-11. Sax, 187 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Korchnoi, Hiibner, Nikolic, Yudasin, Dolma¬ tov and Dreev — 8, etc. Together with Tim- man, Speelman and Yusupov (finalist and semi-finalists in the previous cycle) they made up seven match pairs, and then the seven winners were joined by Karpov (as participant in the 1990 world championship match) and so on. In the spring, Korchnoi warmed up for the Interzonal with two four-player grandmaster tournaments — a triple-round event in Beer- sheva and a double-round event in Rotterdam. In both he finished first and, as later in Ma¬ nila, he was undefeated throughout. It is amusing that the following fine game with the 26-year-old Israeli grandmaster Alon Greenfeld, played at the start in Beersheva, turned out to be the only one in the tourna¬ ment to end decisively! Game 43 V.Korchnoi-A.Greenfeld Beersheva 1990 English OpeningA30 1 c4 £if6 2 £ic3 c5 3 £>f3 e6 4 g3 b6 5 ±g2 Ab7 6 0-0 Ae7 After 6...a6 7 b3 d6 Korchnoi also played d2-d4, and after ...cxd4 he replied either ®xd4 - against S.Garcia (Moscow 1975), or <S)lxd4 — against Hjartarson (Reykjavik 1988) and Ivan¬ chuk (Tilburg 1989). 7 b3 In order later, after d2-d4 and ...cxd4, to possibly recapture on d4 with the knight. Af¬ ter the direct 7 d4 cxd4 8 ®xd4 in the old days Korchnoi many times faced 8...^)lc6 or 8.. .0-0 and ...£k6 (Game No.16), and in the ‘hedgehog’ era — 8...d6 followed by ,..^bd7. 7.. .d6 7...d5 8 cxd5 £W15 is good for Black, with equality. But, as Korchnoi apdy observed, hedgehog lovers do not want an equal game. 8 d4 (8 ±b2 0-0 9 e3 a6 10 d4 cxd4 11 £kd4 is slower, Korchnoi-Portisch, 9th matchgame, Bad Kissingen 1983) 8...cxd4 9 ®xd4 After 9 4^xd4 Jtxg2 10 <i)xg2 Hfc7 11 e4 a6 12 jtb2 Wb7 13 flel 0-0 Black has fewer problems (Korchnoi-Polugayevsky, Biel 1986). Korchnoi has already commented on hedgehog’ positions of this type (cf. Game No.16). And in the introduction to this game he adds: *To some extent hedgehog lovers are right. They are convinced that the main thing in chess is not material, and not space, but the coordination and activity of the pieces — and this coordination can be achieved even in re¬ stricted space. And such play came into fash¬ ion. Whereas earlier it was considered ex¬ tremely undesirable to concede the centre, now dozens of players, literally from the first moves, concede the centre and begin erecting their defences along the 6th rank. I think that the reader will understand why for me, brought up with an orthodox understanding of chess, the given game is very precious.’ 9.. Abd7?! Not the most accurate move order, which is also the case with 9...a6?! 10 Jta3! (prevent¬ ing ...^)lbd7) 10...0-0 11 Bfdl with pressure for White (Korchnoi-A.Greenfeld, Beersheva 1988). But nowadays everyone knows that 9.. .0-0! is correct, for example: 10 jtb2 (if 10 jka3, then 10...^a6!) 10...a6 11 SfcU £>bd7 12 1W2 Wc7 13 £M4 ±xg2 14 <4>xg2 Wb7+ 15 f3 £>e5L. V2-V2 (Korchnoi-Polugayevsky, 11th matchgame, Buenos Aires 1980). 10 ^b5! Korchnoi’s novelty, which he first em- 188 Viktor the Terrible ployed in the 6th game of his Candidates match with Hjartarson (Saint John 1988). By attacking the d6-pawn, he causes a certain dis¬ harmony in the opponent’s ranks. 10...£>c5 If 10...£ie4? White was intending 11 Wxg7 J*,f6 12 Wfh6 Jtxal 13 £}g5! with a powerful attack. However, after 10...d5!? 11 cxd5 JLxdS 12 Wf4 0-0 13 itb2 a6 14 4}c3 he would have had only a comparatively slight advantage. 11 fidl £rte4?! An unsuccessful piece of preparation by Greenfeld. He had already played this against Andersson (Thessaloniki Olympiad 1988) and lost, but now he had apparently found some improvement. 11...d5 was now essential, following the ex¬ ample of the aforementioned source game Korchnoi-Hjartarson, which was brilliantly won by the veteran: 12 cxd5 exd5 (Black also does not equalise folly after 12...4£ixd5 13 e4 or 12 JLkB 13 *Tf4) 13 Jth3!? 0-0 14 Ab2 a6 15 4^c3 Se8 16 2acl *he6? 17 Axe6! fee6 18 £k4 b5 19 4ic5 Ac8 20 £le5 with a complete bind. The young Icelandic grandmaster clearly un¬ derestimated his opponent’s strategic idea. 12 tbcg7! Another brilliant novelty! White gives up a rook and then begins an attack with his knights in the spirit of Morphy or Chigorin. The Anders son-Greenfeld game went 12 b4 Af6 13 #e3 Axal 14 bxc5 bxc5 15 £ig5!

On this occasion Greenfeld was apparendy intending to try 14.. .0-0 or 12...a6, but Korchnoi forestalled him, demonstrating his own, highly impressive interpretation of the variation. 12.. .1.f6.13 WhS Axal 14 £ig5! A mind-boggling position, which to play for the first time is difficult as White (he is, after all, a rook down) and especially as Black: he can become confused in searching for the best defence! 14.. .1te5? A seemingly natural, but incorrect move. Citing an extensive analysis by grandmaster Matthias Wahls, Korchnoi suggests that The only possibility of avoiding a rapid defeat is 14.. .tff6!: 15 £ke4 £lxe4 16 Axc4 Wxh6 17 JLxh6 jtxe4 18 ‘23xd6+ l4>e7 19 lS3xe4 Ae5 (19..Jk.f6? 20 Jlcl!) 20 f4 ±b2 21 Hbl Ad4+ 22 &g2 HhgB (22...f6 23 e3! ±xe3 24 jLg7) 23 i.g5+ f6 24 ±,h4 Ig6 25 &f3 a5 (25...h5 26 b4! and there is no defence against the threat of e2-e3) 26 g4 — White has a clear positional advantage.’ The immediate 25 b4!? Uc8 26 ^13 (with the idea of 26...Sxc4? 27 e3) is perhaps even better. White has two pawns for the exchange and an obvious advantage in view of the unfor¬ tunate position of the black bishop. Therefore Black should defend with 20...Jlf6 (S.Kuzne- tsov-Mayorov, correspondence 1994) or 189 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 21.. Jtf6!? 22 &£2 Shg8 with good drawing chances. 15 b4!? It is strange that in his book My Best Games Volume 1 (2001) Korchnoi makes no comment at all on this move (nor does Ftacnik in Chess- Base), although back in 1990 in Informator he indicated a simpler way to win - 15 ^\xe4! Axe4 (or 15...£hte4 16 jtxe4 Jtxe4 17 f4 etc.) 16 Ag5! f6 17 f4 fxg5 18 fxe5 with an irre¬ sistible attack. I would add 16...Wd7 17 £4!

According to Korchnoi, 17 bxc5 Jtxg2 18 f4 was also possible, but here after 18...Jtd4+! 19 B(£\)xd4 dxc5 Black saves the game. 17...Axg2 (17...±al? 18 £\xd6+! <4^7*19 bxc5 Jlxg2 20 Jta3! bxc5 21 4)xg2 and wins) 18fxe5 CA picturesque position.

White has good winning chances, but the battle is not yet over.’ (Korchnoi). But in my view, after 28... Jte8 29 ^e5 Bc8 the endgame is still altogether unclear: why should Black lose when he is the exchange up?! Therefore I would prefer 23 JLb2! Bxa8 (23...±xa8 24 Axe5 Bc8 25 fifl and wins) 24 Bfl! (not 24 Axe5 £>e4) 24...Bg8 (24...£>e4 25 Bxf7+ 4e8 26 Bc7 ^xg5 27 flxc6 4d7 28 Ba6 and wins) 25 Jtxe5 Bg6 (25...^e4 26 ^ixf7) 26 Jtd6+ 4e8 27 ^G with an extra pawn and a technically won ending. 21...£ie4!?

I was afraid that after 22 cxb6 Black would move his king to g7, but he would hardly have been able to hold a position where he was two pawns down, with one of them already on the 7th rank!’ (Korchnoi). That is, 23 bxa7 2c8 24 Jte3 with an easy win. 22...fig8 (22...4>g7 23 J,xe5 <A>g6 24 fffl was no better) 23 JLxe5 el If 23...£ie8, then 24 4ixh7+ <4^7 25 Ad6+ 4?d7 26 Jtf4+.

In the pre-computer era Korchnoi found and developed a risky gambit idea, which radically changed the char¬ acter of the battle. His opponent was a grandmaster who had devoted much attention to the opening and was reputed to be an ex¬ cellent analyst, but in the given instance, al¬ ready at a very early stage, he fell victim to Korchnoi’s vivid imagination... In 1991 Korchnoi won his Candidates match with Sax on a tie-break (3-3; 21/2-l1/2), but in his next, quarter-final match he lost to Timman (2y2-4y2). In the next Interzonal tournament (Biel 1993) he fought with all his might: he started with 2 out of 2, for six rounds he was in the leading group, he re¬ sponded to two defeats with a couple of wins, and only after losing in the penultimate round to Anand (a time-trouble blunder in an equal ending) did he part with the hope of becom¬ ing one of the Candidates for the crown for the 11th time(!!). Not long before this Korchnoi played an eight-game training match with the 25-year- old Dutch grandmaster Jeroen Piket, which he won by the crushing score 6-2 (+4=4). In the 3rd game Piket was given a good lesson with Black in the Tarrasch Defence.

It is better to play ll..JLe7 12 ^d4, when 12.. .^xd4P! 13 ®xd4 leads to an old tabija, known from the games Rubinstein-Salwe (Lodz 1908) and Marshall-Rubinstein (Lodz 1908; Karlsbad 1911), and 12...h6 - to more modem positions of the type 13 Jte3 Wd7 14 Wa4 Jlh3 with an acceptable game (Korchnoi-Nunn, Hastings 1975/76). 12 b3! A very strong, deep move of Rubinstein, creating the threat of Jtxf6 and ^xd5. 12...d4?! 12...fie8 13 e3! (Rubinstein-Lasker, Berlin 1918) leads to a slight but enduring advantage for White. The move in the game allows the spoiling of Black's pawns, making it even harder for him to equalise. 13 ®e4 ®e7 (vacating the d8-square for the rook) 14 ®h4!? Again a novelty, and in a rare variation! Be¬ fore this 14 <5}xf6+ or 14 ^fd2 had been played. 14...&H8 15 ±xf6 gxf6 16 #d2 £>e5 (16.J5? 17 Wh6\ fxe4 18 ±xe4 £5 19 £ig6+) 17 ®h6 £g6 18 ®h5!, and after a tough struggle, not without its mistakes, White won the game. In the end, Piket, like many of Korchnoi’s other young opponents, was un¬ able to withstand the tension! I think that after this match catastrophe Piket developed a ‘Korchnoi complex’: from then on Jeroen normally played very badly and unsuccessfully against him. Thus in 2000 in Wijk aan Zee the Dutchman was not in bad form — he beat Timman and Short, and made draws with me, Kramnik and Anand, but in the last round he was unable to withstand the onslaught of Korchnoi, who was on a minus score and was aiming to improve his affairs at least a little. In Groningen at the end of 1993 there took place a qualifying tournament for the world championship of the recently created Profes¬ sional Chess Association (PCA), which was superior even to an Interzonal in strength. In the eleven rounds Korchnoi managed to win only one game, but what a game! And, inci¬ dentally, again against a young grandmaster. Game 45 G.Serper-V. Korchnoi Groningen 1993, 9th round _English Opening A29_ 1 c4 £if6 2 £>c3 e5 3 £>f3 £>c6 4 g3 d5 5 cxd5 ®xd5 6 ±q2 £>b6 7 0-0 &e7 8 Sbl g5!? Instead of the usual 8...0-0 9 b4! (an exam¬ ple: Kasparov-Timman, Wijk aan Zee 2001). After this game the audacious lunge 8...g5 be¬ came quite popular, although, in my view, given accurate play by White it cannot achieve anything good for Black. It is another matter when you encounter such a move for the first time... ‘In my ardour to try an experiment, I was inspired by the following remarkable, but 192 Viktor the Terrible nearly forgotten game, Smyslov-Korchnoi (Moscow 1960): 1 e4 c5 2 ^f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 <$3xd4 ^3f6 5 0\c3 g6 6 Jte2 jtg7 7 ^3b3 £lc6 8 g4 b6 (8...d5!?) 9 f4 Ab7 10 ±f3 0-0 11 h4 a5 12 a4 £ft>4 13 h5 d5 14 e5 £kg4 15 £k!4 £>h6 16 hxg6 fxg6 17 £ie6 Wfd7 18 &xf8 Sxf8 19 £ib5 d4 20 ±xb7 #xb7 21 0-0 £>f5 22 £kd4 ^xd4 23 #xd4 Wc8 24 Wc4 £>xc2 with a draw on the 37th move/ (Korchnoi) 9 d3 If 9 d4, then 9...exd4 10 £>b5 11 Sal Jk,e4 is equal (Claesen-M.Gurevich, Antwerp 1994). The gambit 9 b4!P is more interesting: 9.. .g4 10 £iel ^3xb4 11 thc2 ^c6!P 12 JLxc6+! bxc6 13 d4 with sharp play (Gulko-Benjamin, USA Championship 1997; Khalifman-Lutz, New Delhi 2000). 9.. .h5 A novelty. 9...g4 is inadequate: 10 £}el h5 11 ^c2 h4 12 b4, as in the source game Hodgson-Bareev (Belgrade 1993). However, Korchnoi did not know about this game and did not consider 9...h5 to be an improvement. "A worthwhile try is the set-up chosen by Smyslov: 9...f5 and ..Af6.’ 10 a3 h4 11 b4 hxg3 12 hxg3 a6 13 b5 ®d4?!

Overlooking Black’s reply. "Here we come across a phenomenon which I would like to call the ""young Tal effect”,’ writes Korchnoi about White’s 14th-16th moves. "Playing a game with all your energy, emanating a kind of hypnotic influence and an air of absolute con¬ fidence, a player can sometimes convince his opponent that his tricks are watertight and absolutely irrefutable! I knew Tal very well, and he was aware, indeed, proud of his hyp¬ notic abilities. As for me, I have never had any idea of what happens fl^the board - until Ser¬ per started to show me variations in the post¬ mortem analysis.’ (Korchnoi) 16...^a4!

Many other young players also found it hard to withstand such a creative approach by Korchnoi to the solving of complex problems, and his primordial, ‘crooked’ style. When I met him at the super-tournament in the Swiss town of Horgen (1994), before my eyes, with the black pieces, he completely perplexed Bo¬ ris Gelfand — a good theoretician and one of the top ten grandmasters in the world, who had played in several Candidates matches. Game 46 B.Gelfand-V. Korchnoi Horgen 1994 Nim^o-lndian Defence E59 1 d4 2 c4 e6 3 <£>c3 (Boris far more often plays 3 S}£3) 3...±b4 4 e3 c5 5 ±d3 d5 6 $}f3 0-0 7 0-0 £>c6 8 a3 ±xc3 9 bxc3 dxc4 10 ±xc4 #c7 11 Aa2 e5 12 h3 12...b6!? (instead of the traditional 12...e4 — a novelty with the idea of ...e5-e4 and ... Jta6-d3; currently 12.. Jtf5 is fashionable) 13 ®c2?! After a long think Gelfand does not choose the best reply. 13 fiel e4 14 ^d2 leads to a roughly equal game (Knaak-Korchnoi, Baden- Baden 1995). But the main continuation became 13 d5 e4 (or 13..JSd8 14 e4) 14 dxc6 (if 14 £3h2 or 14 ^3d2, then 14...4ie5 with equality) 14...exf3 15 ®x£3 with some advantage for White. Here 15.. .We5 or 15..Jta6 used to be played (these moves are considered by Korchnoi), but then there appeared 15.. JLe6!? 16 JLxe6 fxe6 17 c4 Hac8 18 Jlb2 Wxc6 (Yakovich-Tiviakov, Elista 2001) or first 18...^\e8 (Zifroni- Iordachescu, Panormo 2001), and in either case Black still has to fight for equality. Gelfand did not want to simplify the posi¬ tion immediately, but his move allowed the opponent to brilliantly carry out his plan. At that time I had only a rather vague impression of this variation and, observing the game at odd moments, I was very surprised when the black bishop appeared at d3 within a few moves. A couple of days later, when I was chatting with Boris, we talked admiringly about the grand scale of Korchnoi’s ideas... 13.. .e4 14 £>g5 i.a6 15 fldl (15 £ixe4 £lxe4 16 Wxe4 JLxfl 17 ^xfl Bae8 etc. is inadequate for White) 15.. .Hae8!

But in the next round Korchnoi won against Lautier, and he and I were leading the tournament with 4 points out of 5. Then Viktor Lvovich reduced speed and allowed Shirov and Yusupov to go half a point ahead of him. But at the very finish, playing Black against the 15-year-old Peter Leko, who had then only just entered the world arena, he fought des¬ perately for the win which would enable him to cling on to a share of 2nd place (it need hardly be said that the opening was a French Defence). Throughout the tournament Peter had played very cautiously, and Korchnoi, I remember, even speculated: T wonder how Peter will play when he’s 50, if he plays like this at the age of 15?’ But in this encounter the young Hungarian had to engage in an open battle, and after great complications and a wild time scramble it ended in a draw. At the Turn of the Century At the end of 1994 Korchnoi appeared for the Swiss team at the Olympiad in Moscow. This was his third visit to his homeland since his defection back in 1976. In the summer of 1990 the USSR President Mikhail Gorbachov had restored Soviet citizenship to many cul¬ tural figures who were out of favour, including Korchnoi. It stands to reason that Viktor Lvovich was pleased with this decision, stat¬ ing: ‘I see this as a recognition of my contribu¬ tion to the development of chess in the USSR’ Nevertheless, he declined the Soviet offer, since he was waiting to obtain Swiss citizenship. And only after receiving it, did he fly in the spring of 1992 to his native Lenin¬ grad, which by that time had already been re¬ named St Petersburg. And in the spring of 1994 he also visited Moscow, where he played in the PCA ‘Kremlin Stars’ tournament (the first stage of the rapidplay Intel Grand Prix — later Korchnoi also played in New York, Lon¬ don and Paris). Since then he has happily taken part in chess events held on the territory of the for¬ mer USSR. Perhaps the most interesting of these was the grandmaster tournament in St Petersburg (April 1997), which assembled vir¬ tually the entire cream of Leningrad chess from the second half of the 20th century, apart from Spassky and Taimanov. Meeting for the first time on the same stage were six 195 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors emigrants (Korchnoi, Sosonko, Tseitlin, Salov, Yudasin and Komarov), and six ‘native’ St Petersburg players (Khalifman, Svidler, Sa- kaev, Epishin, Aseev and S.Ivanov). Among the tournament favourites was the 20-year-old two-times Russian Champion Pe¬ ter Svidler, and rightly so: he soon won the national championship for the third time, shared victory with me and Kramnik in Til¬ burg (1997) and became one of the leading grandmasters in the world. But on this occa¬ sion Peter considerably underperformed, and the reason for this was evidently the following wonderful game, prior to which both players had 3 points out of 6 and still retained hopes of a successful finish. The age difference be¬ tween them was 45 years! Game 47 V.Korchnoi-P.

And again Korchnoi makes a re¬ markable comment: ‘Malicious tongues will say: Svidler was unlucky — his preparations for this meeting were based on a game that I had played 13 years earlier, and he found an improvement there. But I had forgotten that game, and played differently, and even, they will say, more strongly. Well, firstly, it would have been 196 Viktor the Terrible good for Emanuel Lasker to remember his games, and during those 13 years I had played twice as many games as Doctor (of Philoso¬ phy) Lasker played in his entire chess career! And secondly, wrould it not be tedious, espe¬ cially considering the number of games that I have played, to repeat the same thing several times? Even for the sake of practical success. For me, with my character, it would be rather tedious. And one more point: I do not con¬ sider myself to be such a classical player, that it is forbidden to make changes. And I make changes with particular pleasure, improving on my own play. Therefore, with only rare excep¬ tions, I play the opening of every game as if for the first time in my life.’ 13...®df6?! Strangely enough, this is almost the decisive mistake! 13...&k5?l is also insufficient: 14 b4 ^xe4 (14...^a6 15 a3 or, according to Khalifinan, 15 dxc6 bxc6 16 b5 with the sei¬ zure of the d5-square) 15 ^gxe4 fxe4 16 dxc6 bxc6 17 Wxc4y and ‘the c6-pawn would have been lost5 (Korchnoi). Therefore the com¬ mentators recommended the not very pretty move 13...^ib6, which, although it does not equalise, would nevertheless have allowed Black to put up a tough defence. 14f3£ih6 15 c5! (temporarily sacrificing a pawn, White exploits the lack of harmony in the placing of the enemy pieces) 15...cxd5 As shown by Korchnoi, Black also has great difficulties after 15...dxc5 16 dxc6 bxc6 17 £k4 or 16...b6 17 £id5 etc. 16®xd5!

A deep and far from obvious combination — not without reason did Spassky, the hon¬ oured guest of the tournament, award Korchnoi the prize for the most brilliant game. And Svidler, after stopping the clocks, shook his opponent’s hand and said: It’s a pity that I’m not wearing a hat — I would have raised it to you!’ According to Alexander Khalifman, Peter was in a state of shock after this defeat and later he asked in surprise: Took what’s going on: in 1984 Korchnoi played quite well, now he plays even better, so what will happen in 2010?’ Yes, even at the age of 66 Viktor Lvovich played with truly youthful ardour! In the 9th round he beat Sakaev in fine style, employing a novelty in a favourite variation of his since the time of Baguio (1 d4 ^lf6 2 c4 e6 3 £k3 jtb4 4 e3 c5 5 %3e2 cxd4 6 exd4 d5 7 e5 ^e4 8 g3!?), in the 10th round he overcame Ep- ishin with Black in a topical variation of the Queen’s Gambit Accepted, and in the end, scoring 7 out of 11, he shared victory in the tournament with Khalifman and Salov. 1 have to admit,’ said Korchnoi in an interview, ‘that the support of the auditorium, which was al¬ ways full, inspired me, and for perhaps the first time in my life I was aware of invisible energy from the spectators.’ The duel with Epishin had an unusual epi¬ logue: a month later, in the European Team Championship, Alexander Beliavsky (inciden¬ tally, now the only four-times USSR Cham¬ pion still alive, apart from Korchnoi) was de¬ feated in the same way. My attention was at¬ tracted by both the opening plan, and the comments of the winner. 198 Viktor the Terrible Game 48 A. Belia vsky-V. Ko r ch no i Pula 1997 Queen's Gambit Accepted D20 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 ‘The Queen’s Gambit Accepted: possibly again the influence of the world champions?’ — this was how Korchnoi commented on the move of his opponent Petersons in 1965 (hav¬ ing in mind the influence of Petrosian, who successfully played this opening in his match with Botvinnik), and in 1995 he thought it necessary to add: World champions undoubt¬ edly influence chess fashion.

In September 1997 Korchnoi played a match of six games with the rising start of French chess, the 14-year-old Etienne Bacrot and won 4-2. A year earlier Bacrot had crushed Smyslov (5-1), but it should not be forgotten that Vasily Vasilievich, being exactly ten years older than Korchnoi, by that time had already switched to the Veteran regime5. But Korchnoi had as though forgotten about his age, and he continued to batde successfully with the best grandmasters of every genera¬ tion, ignoring the world senior championship. True, he played with pleasure in exhibition matches and match-tournaments such as "Vet¬ erans against the strongest women players5 or "Veterans against young talents5. Thus in Feb¬ ruary 1998, Korchnoi, Spassky, Gligoric and Taimanov played a double-round event with Bacrot, Ponomariov, Nataf and Shaked. In his eight games Korchnoi gained more wins than anyone else (four!), like Spassky he scored "plus two5, and the veterans won overall by I6V2-I5V2. Then in March 1999 Viktor Lvovich again travelled to St Petersburg and "finally settled matters5 with Spassky, defeating him in a rapidplay match of ten games: 6-4 (+4—2=4). At the turn of the century he took part in three FIDE world championships held on the knock-out system (1997, 1999 and 2001): in the second round in Groningen he lost in a fierce struggle on the tie-break to Short, in Las Vegas he overcame Dolmatov in a tie-break but then went down to Kramnik, and in Mos¬ cow, again on a tie-break, he suffered a defeat against Psakhis (incidentally, twice winner of the USSR Championship). The level of Korchnoi’s preparation is well illustrated by a game from his mini-match with Sergey Dol¬ matov, which began with 1 c4. Here is his commentary: "When preparing for the match, I noticed that Dolmatov relies mainly on the Dutch Defence, in two of its branches: the Stonewall and the Leningrad Variation — set-ups that are very active, but not fashionable, and certainly not 100% sound. A rather strange choice, where I suspect an unusual psychological ap¬ proach. The majority of grandmasters have developed a scornful attitude to dubious openings. Perhaps subconsciously there exists a desire to punish the impudent opponent as quickly as possible — ‘"How dare he play this opening against me?!55 And meanwhile, this opening has been thoroughly analysed in his home laboratory. Disillusionment awaits the grandmaster playing White — using routine methods this so-called dubious opening will not be breached! This psychological context was clear to me, and so I prepared seriously. Even so, I did not manage to find a clear ad¬ vantage in the Stonewall after 1 d4. This was why I preferred to begin the game with 1 c4, in order to have the option of employing the set-up with the white pawn at d3.5 The game went 1...f5 2 £\f3 3 g3 d6!

(a blunder in a difficult position) 22 £to7! 1-0. A model example of a psychological opening win. And here is another characteristic comment from his introduction to this game: It is hard to find a place on this earth where there is less interest in chess than in Las Vegas — there are enough amusements there without chess! Nevertheless, that was the appointed venue for a major chess event, which influential FIDE officials even called the World Cham¬ pionship.’ Typical Korchnoi! It is staggering that even at the age of 70 he did not reduce his playing activity and the geography of his appearances remained just as broad as before: Olympiads in Istanbul (2000), Bled (2002) and Calva (2004), the traditional tournaments in Wijk aan Zee (2000) and Biel (2001-03), the Stein Memorial in Lvov (2000) and the Najdorf Memorial in Buenos Aires (2001), where, incidentally, he defeated Judit Polgar in a French Defence ... A notable event was Korchnoi’s match with the 17-year-old Ruslam Ponomariov, the future FTDE world champion (Donetsk, Janu¬ ary 2001). The age difference between the two players was almost 53 years! This match of eight games was a very tough one and ended with a score of 4-4 (+2—2=4). Korchnoi’s two wins were gained with White in a well-tested line of the English Opening: 1 c4 c5 2 £if3 £>f6 3 £ic3 £iC6 4 d4 cxd4 5 &xd4 e6 6 a3!?

These games are of interest primarily for seeing bow Korchnoi outplayed Ponomariov by creating unclear positions, full of life, the veteran tired out his young opponent in pro¬ tracted play, with time-troubles and mutual errors — and in the end the exhausted Ruslan cracked under the tension and made the last mistake! For Ponomariov the match with Korchnoi became roughly the same excellent schooling as was the match with Reshevsky in 1961 for the 18-year-old Fischer. The young Ukrainian grandmaster grasped the logic of matchplay and made a sharp leap forward. Largely thanks to this invaluable experience, a year later he was able to win the FIDE world championship in Moscow, defeating in mini¬ matches Morozevich, Bareev and Svidler, and in the final — Ivanchuk (AV2-2V2). His opponent also shone after this match, winning a very strong double-round tourna¬ ment in Biel in the summer of 2001: 1. Korchnoi - 6 out of 10; 2. Svidler — 5Vi; 3. Gelfand — 5; 4-6. Grischuk, Lautier and Pelletier — 4Y2. It goes without saying that this was an excellent present for his own 70th birthday (which was also marked in the spring by rapidplay tournaments in St Petersburg and Zurich). In November he added to this a share of 1st place in an open tournament on Curasao, dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the famous and, for Korchnoi, equally dra¬ matic Candidates tournament (cf. the chapter ‘Drama on Curasao*). Incidentally, Karpov likes to count the number of first places that he was taken or shared in various tournaments, including team events and even the most insignificant ones. Here he has passed well over a hundred and he considers himself to be the absolute record holder — and it would appear that this is so (although the picture would be different if only super-tournaments were counted). But if an equally scrupulous count were to be made for Korchnoi — who knows, might he not overtake his historic opponent? February 2003 found Korchnoi in Reykja¬ vik, where he played successfully in a category 15 tournament: 1. Shirov — 7 out of 9; 2-3. Korchnoi and Made]a — 6; 4-5. McShane and I.Sokolov — SVi; 6. Adams — 5, etc. In finish¬ ing so high in the final table, he was helped by a last-round win over his ‘old opponent’, the now 20-year-old Bacrot.

The position after 9 0-0^ 0-0 had already occurred with the young Frenchman, and he was ready for both the sluggish 10 e3 (Mednis-Bacrot, 4th matchgame, Cannes 1996), and the ques¬ tionable 10 ^h4 ^b6 11 Wb3 Wxd4 (Rogers- Bacrot, Batumi rapidplay 2001). 9.,.Wb6 (9...^b6 would have diverted the knight from the key e5-square) 10 £}d2 Ag6 On encountering an unfamiliar plan, Bacrot makes a cautious prophylactic move, although the simple 10...0-0 would have given Black a normal game: 11 e4 Jtg6 12 ^hc4 ®xb3 13 axb3 Ab4 14 f3 c5, or 11 ^hc4 ®xb3 12 axb3 Ab4 13 Af4 a5 V2rV2 (Goldin-Dreev, No¬ vosibirsk 1989). 11 £ic4 Wxb3 ll.Jfi^ati!? came into consideration. By ex¬ changing queens, Black steps into his oppo¬ nent’s territory: the playing of complicated endings with prospects of an initiative has for a long time been Korchnoi’s forte! 12 axb3 £id5 13 0-0 f5?! Bacrot makes a move on general, positional grounds, supporting his knight at d5 and planning counterplay against the doubled fa- pawns. But Korchnoi, as we will now see, also takes into account the dynamic factors of the position, transforming his weaknesses into a strength! 13...^7b6? 14 ^3xd5 ^3xd5 15 Jtxd5 cxd5 16 £\b6! was dearly bad for Black. However, after 13...0-0 (Khuxman) he would have had every chance of equalising, for example: 14 ^a5 Hfb8 15 e4 £lb4 16 Af4 e5! 17 dxe5 (17 Axe5 4fxe5 18 dxe5 £>d3) 17...£lc5 18 ^c4 £3xb3 19 fiadl ^3c5 etc. 14 fta5 0-0-0 This all appears very logical... 15 Jkxd5! An unpleasant surprise: White suddenly be¬ gins an attack on the king! Gufdd once said that at the board it is psychologically difficult to consider variations with the exchange of a bishop for a knight, and the threat of such an exchange is often underestimated. In the given instance Korchnoi exploits the concrete fea¬ tures of the position — the ^holes’ around the black king. It is important for White to retain his knight at c3, in order to threaten £lb5. 15„.exd5 (15...cxd5? 16 Afl) 16 Af4 (with the threat of £\xd5) 16.. .£lb8?!

Three games ended in draws, but Korchnoi won against Fressinet and brought victory to his native city. The list of his appearances in 2003-5 re¬ mained almost equally as intensive as before. Korchnoi greeted the New Year 2005 at a tournament in Drammen in Norway, where he defeated the 14-year-old Magnus Carlsen — at that moment the youngest grandmaster in history. The difference in age between them was 59 years! Only with Smyslov was there a greater difference (62), when he played Bacrot Also phenomenal is the gap in the dates of birth of opponents against whom Korchnoi has played serious games: from Levenfish (1889) to Carlsen (1990), i.e. 101 years! Only Smyslov has more: from Duz-Khorimirsky (1881) to Bacrot (1983). However, at ‘Smys¬ lov’s age’ Korchnoi is achieving higher results and for the moment he is obviously not in¬ tending to stop at what he has achieved. Thus at the Geller Memorial (Odessa, July 2005) he was battling at rapidplay chess with the 12- year-old Ukrainian Stanislav Bogdanovich... What is the secret of Korchnoi’s unique chess longevity? Whereas the prolonging of Smyslov’s career was helped by his innate sense of harmony and incredible intuition, back in Soviet times Korchnoi had qualities ascribed to him, which were supposedly typi¬ cal of Botvinnik; it was said that for success you must without fail develop in yourself a hostility towards your opponent, and enter into a conflict which will unsettle him and raise your own fighting spirit However, life has shown that this is far from the truth. Yes, Korchnoi has a difficult character (but who has an easy one?). Everyone knows his acri¬ monious, biting comments, which normally precisely hit their target Of course, over the past half century he has many times experi¬ enced strong hostility, but this can hardly be the leitmotif of such a long and brilliant ca¬ reer. It seems to me that, apart from enormous talent, it is also a question of Korchnoi’s self¬ less love for chess and his supreme profes¬ sionalism. All his life he has been tirelessly relearning, and working on the improvement of his style. Spassky rightly considers Korchnoi to be an ‘extraordinary hard workeri and says with a smile: ‘When he lived in the USSR, I called him a hero of socialist labour, but when he moved to the West I awarded him the title of hero of capitalist labour!’ The key to understanding the Korchnoi phenomenon can be found in the annotations to his own games. What mercilessness with respect to himself, what forceful, objective evaluations! It is this ultra-critical approach to chess problems, developed from his youth, that enables Korchnoi to retain his clarity of thinking and to continue developing. In com¬ bination with robust health, this is the basis for chess longevity. I should like to conclude this chapter about Viktor Korchnoi with some wonderful words by his former second and compatriot, grand¬ master Genna Sosonko: ‘Once, after he had found a new idea as a result of lengthy analysis, I advised him not to employ it in a tournament that seemed to me 205 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors less significant, but to keep it for some more important event. “For another tournament Til think up something new,” replied Viktor, “I don’t store up novelties.” ‘As a rule, Korchnoi’s opening finds are not simply a move or a manoeuvre, strengthening a variation or refuting a generally-accepted evaluation. In the majority of cases it is a ques¬ tion of a whole complex of ideas, a new con¬ ception in a particular defence or system. And although he has not given his name to any openings, Korchnoi’s creations have given an impulse to the development of many of them for decades. His interpretation of positions from the French Defence, when the presence of an isolated pawn is more that compensated by good piece play, the Tartakower Variation in the Queen’s Gambit, the Open Variation of the Spanish, which was considered not fully satis factory after the 1948 match-tournament and was revived by Korchnoi at the very highest level, including matches for the world champi¬ onship, forced the evaluation of many opening set-ups to be reviewed. He devised and intro¬ duced a paradoxical knight sortie on the 4th move, which started a whole new branch in the English Opening (1 c4 e5 2 ^c3 £}f6 3 ^f3 ^c6 4 g3 £}d4!?). The variation of the Griin- feld Defence, which today is considered the main one in this opening and has caused Black a mass of problems (1 d4 4if6 2 c4 g6 3 ^c3 d5 4 cxd5 £ixd5 5 e4 4ixc3 6 bxc3 JLg7 7 £>£3), was first properly employed by Korchnoi. Many variations of the King’s Indian — an opening which he considers very difficult for Black, and in the depths of his heart even dubious, are inconceivable in modern theory without the name of Korchnoi.’ CHAPTER TWO Anatoly the Twelfth God-Given Talent At the turn of the 1960s-1970s, when alarm was growing in the USSR about the lack of new world stars, there finally appeared an amazing young talent on the chess stage — Anatoly Ev¬ genyevich Karpov (bom 23 May 1951). His deep, infiltrating style, subtle positional feeling, and extraordinary persistence, practicality and flexibility rapidly raised him to the very summit of chess. It would appear that in 1975 Fischer was the first to clearly discern all these qualities in Karpov, and he realised that such an oppo¬ nent might prove too tough for him. Karpov’s play was always distinguished by its exceptionally high degree of efficiency. In contrast to Korchnoi or me, Karpov was not a researcher in the openings and he did not work so much on chess, but he was very skil¬ ful at selecting and absorbing new ideas, and then making brilliant use of them in practice. How many points, especially with White, did he gather literally out of nothing! An ability to quickly grasp trends of chess development, which at one time also distinguished Lasker, helped Karpov to find his place in the chang¬ ing conditions of the late 20th century. The glorious chess career of the 12th world champion can be arbitrarily divided into four periods — the four phases of his creative strength, which constitute the greatest interest as regards his contribution to chess: 1. 1968-75. A time of rapid creative growth and the forming of his style, when the basis of his classical understanding of chess was laid. Here a very great role was played by Karpov’s permanent trainer — grandmaster Semion Furman. The peak of this very important pe¬ riod was his Candidates semi-final match with Spassky (1974). 2.1975-85. The time when Karpov held the champion’s tide. A slowing of creative growth: he is evidently "oppressed’ by the unplayed match with Fischer. Initially Karpov reaps the fruits of his great preceding work, and this is quite sufficient to silence talk of him being a "paper champion’. The very difficult match with Korchnoi (1978) forces Karpov to seek reserves of improvement in his game. And in the early 1980s he climbs to a new level. The peak of this period is our first match (1984/85). The most difficult experience in his career: he does not win this match, after lead¬ ing 5-0 — and he loses our second match (1985). 207 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 3. 1986-90. The time of Karpov’s ‘second wind’. Demonstrating phenomenal willpower, he finds the strength to play a return match (1986) and to complete a resolute rebuilding of his opening repertoire — giving up his fa¬ vourite move 1 e4, and so on. I think that this was our best match and one of the best matches in the history of chess. After losing it, Karpov nevertheless makes a new surge: he brilliantly wins the super-final Candidates match against Andrey Sokolov (the peak of this period!) and almost wins our fourth match (1987). Even the loss of the decisive 24th game does not unsetde him: he shares victory with me in the USSR Championship (1988), plays excellently in the World Cup super-tournaments (1988/89), wins the next Candidates cycle and batdes highly tenaciously in our fifth match (1990). 4. 1991-98. Losing hope of regaining the crown, he experiences dejection and disillusionment: a difficult Candidates match with Anand (1991) and defeat against Short (1992). But after I leave FIDE, Karpov begins a new surge. He wins a match against Timman and becomes FIDE world champion (1993), plays the ‘tournament of his life’ (Linares 1994) and confidently defeats Gata Kamsky in a match (1996) — the peak of this period! And its ending — a further match with Anand (1998), Karpov’s ‘swansong’ in his many years of fighting for the world championship. It is in accordance with these periods that I have arranged my description of the career of the last of my great predecessors. 'A serious Boy!' Karpov was bom into and grew up in the family of a factory foreman, in the small town of Zlatoust in the Urals, not far from Chelyab¬ insk. They were poor — like millions of work¬ ing-class families in the post-war period. Tolya learned chess at the age of four, by watching the play of his father, who then taught his son the rules. But in contrast to the parents of Capablanca and Reshevsky, he did not lose the first games to his son, but won all of them, without exception (this was, after all, the So¬ viet chess school!). 1 was ready to burst into tears,’ Karpov remembers in the book Chess is my Life, written with co-author Alexander Roshal, ‘and I would have done, had it not been for my father’s words: “Someone has to lose, and if you start crying I won’t play with you at all.” Perhaps it was then that I subcon¬ sciously, intuitively began to grasp a very im¬ portant piece of chess wisdom: the threat is stronger than the execution...’ At the age of seven he went along to the chess section of the metallurgical factory sports club, in his very first tournament he fulfilled the 3rd category norm, and after two years of enthusiastic battles he also achieved 1st category. At that time the idol of the youngsters was the young Tal and chess was experiencing a burst of popularity. Tolya’s first chess books were Panov’s books Course in the Openings and Capablanca. By studying the se¬ lected games of the great Cuban, he sharply improved his playing strength and his under¬ standing of the game. He was also taken under the wing of the well-known Chelyabinsk trainer and teacher Leonid Gratvol (who also developed the future grandmasters Ti- moshchenko, Sveshnikov and Panchenko). At the age of 10 Karpov was already adult cham¬ pion of the town and a participant in the adult championship of the region. When he was 12, being the youngest candidate master in the country, he travelled to Moscow, to a session of the recently formed Botvinnik School. Initially the play of the puny boy from the Urals did not make any particular impression on Botvinnik. Karpov: ‘His remarks regarding my completely feeble handling of the opening had their effect: I began reading chess litera¬ ture. The favourite at that period of the school was considered to be Yuri Balashov — the fu¬ ture grandmaster, friend and helper of Kar¬ pov. But when Botvinnik, who was passing through Zlatoust, met Tolya’s parents and visited them, he passed the verdict: ‘A good 208 Anatoly the Twelfth family and a serious boy!’ And in the second half of the 1960s he was already predicting a great future for him. Soon the Karpov family moved to Tula, where his father took up the post of chief en¬ gineer at a factory. In those years competitions with the master norm were much rarer than today. Tolya took his chance at the first op¬ portunity — in a tournament 'masters against candidates’ (Leningrad, summer 1966), where he was seconded by the Tula master Anatoly Matsukevich. In exceeding the norm by two points (+5=10), Karpov gained memorable wins over the experienced Chistyakov and Ravinsky, and also made the acquaintance of Igor Zaitsev — an outstanding analyst, together with whom he later went through seven matches for the world championship (and with whom that summer he played an amus¬ ing drawn miniature — cf. Volume 4, Game No.48, note to White’s 6th move). The first foreign tournament in his life was in Trinec in Czechoslovakia (1966/67): 1. Karpov — 11 out of 13 (+9=4); 2-3. Kupka and Kupreichik — 9Vr, 4. Smejkal — 9, etc. In the process the 15-year-old master defeated his main rivals — the 20-year-old Jan Smejkal and the 17-year-old Viktor Kupreichik. Karpov also greeted the next new year abroad — in Groningen in the Netherlands, where the Niemeijer Cup took place, effec¬ tively the European Junior Championship. It is significant that Karpov’s first move was made by the honoured guest. Dr Euwe: at the young player’s command, the ex-world cham¬ pion played e2-e4. The battle took place in two stages: a semi-final (seven-round Swiss system) and a final (all-play-all) tournament of eight. Tolya conducted the semi-final stage with enviable pragmatism: after two wins at the start he made five draws and, by sharing 2nd-6th places, qualified for the final (in pass¬ ing, winning a blitz tournament, which was held on the only free day — 13V2 out of 16). Here his rivals were Jan Timman and Andras Adorjan. Karpov started with 2Vz out of 3, but Timman scored half a point more! A win over the Dutchman in round 4 decided the out¬ come of the tournament The Soviet player then won one more game and took first place with 5Vz out of 7 (+4=3). Botvinnik remarked with satisfaction on the ease of this victory and gave an accurate de¬ scription of Karpov: 'A clever competitor, he always knows when to play for a win, and when he should make a quick draw. In west¬ ern chess circles he was even criticised for the series of short draws in the Groningen tour¬ nament. In itself, of course, this was not very good, but it is surprising and worthy of recog¬ nition that a 16-year-old master should be able to adopt competitive tactics, characteristic of a mature grandmaster.’ In the summer of 1968 Tolya finished sec¬ ondary school with a gold medal and entered the Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University. And here he easily won the University Championship — 10 out of 13 (+7=6). On arriving that autumn at a training session for the Armed Forces team before the USSR Team Cup, he met the trainer of the army players, the Leningrad grandmaster Semion Furman. That was a truly historic meet- ing! Furman later remembered: 'Karpov was enlisted into the team to play on the first junior board. He was a thin, pale-faced youth, rather phlegmatic in appearance. It also appeared that he had difficulty in moving the chess pieces. Was such a player really capable of great com¬ petitive achievements?’ Here Roshal quotes a joke by Gufeld, who was also seeing Tolya for the first time: This boy will never be a grand¬ master — he is too light’ But this did not con¬ cern Furman: Wes, nature did not endow Kar¬ pov with a powerful physique — but on the other hand it bestowed on him a rare chess talent and strength of spirit As well as industri¬ ousness and modesty. When I began working with Karpov, I immediately realised that he was a very capable player with a big future.’ This was already shown by the USSR Team 209 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Cup (Riga, December 1968), where the young master scored 10 out of 11 (+9=2). From then on he constantly improved all parts of his game, especially the opening. Furman, an out¬ standing expert on theory, had the following motto: The opponents must be surrounded by novelties, like a wolf surrounded by red flags when it is being hunted.' And he and Karpov surrounded them! For convenience of working, a year later Tolya moved to Lenin¬ grad and transferred to the Economics Faculty of Leningrad University. Chess became the main thing in his life. Soon he confidently won a six-round quali¬ fying tournament of the three best juniors in the country (Leningrad, spring 1969), and then also the World Junior Championship (Stock¬ holm, August 1969). The only difficulties he had were in the semi-final (he nearly lost to Hug and Torre), but in the final he was irre¬ pressible. His 3rd round encounter with the Swede Ulf Anders son was especially impor¬ tant — Tolya literally suffocated the opponent in his favourite Ruy Lopez. The result: 1. Kar¬ pov — 10 out of 11 (+9=2); 2-3. Adorjan and Urzica — 7; 4. Kaplan - 6V2; 5. Andersson - 6, etc. The first victory, and a brilliant one, by a Soviet player in the world junior champion¬ ships since Spassky's success in 1955! Although by the age of 18 he had achieved a very high standard of play and had become an international master, Karpov had not yet played a single serious game with a grandmas¬ ter — a paradox of that era, when tournaments with a grandmaster norm were a rarity. With a different tempo of life, he might already have been in contention for a place in the ‘Match of the Century' (Belgrade, spring 1970). In the early 1970s Anatoly gradually made up for lost time. The first step was an unequivocal win in the Russian Federation Championship (Kuybyshev, May-June 1970), which had the status of a USSR Champion¬ ship semi-final: 1. Karpov — I2V2 out of 17 (+8=9); 2. Krogius - 11; 3-4. Antoshin and Dementiev — IOV2; behind them came A.Zaitsev, Rashkovsky, Tseshkovsky etc. Then he flew together with Leonid Stein to distant Venezuela, where he finally played in a prestigious international tournament (Caracas, summer 1970). At the start Karpov became the sole leader — 6 out of 7! And, by his own admission, he was already cherishing the most ambitious hopes... When suddenly he was de¬ feated by Ivkov (after declining the offer of a draw), he almost lost to Panno, and he went down against KavaleL ‘Here it is, the danger¬ ous feeling of the goal being close!’ However, after composing himself, he nevertheless achieved the grandmaster norm: 1. Kavalek — 13 out of 17; 2-3. Ivkov and Stein - 12; 4-6. Benko, Karpov and Panno - HV2, etc. Making his debut in the 38th USSR Cham¬ pionship (Riga, November-December 1970), he immediately established himself among the leading players in the country: 1. Korchnoi — 16 out of 21; 2. Tukmakov — I4V2; 3. Stein — 14; 4. Balashov — I2V2; 5-7. Gipslis, Karpov and Savon — 12, etc. But more had been ex¬ pected of him. He was criticised for his over¬ cautious play — 14 draws! Tal thinks that the youth Vas still too respectful towards his sen¬ ior opponents, and had not managed to rid himself of his timidity towards them.’ Furman answers for his protege: ‘In his position now it is hard to experiment. He is obliged to achieve a good result, to ensure himself competitive success. So he has to restrain his emotions, his creative impulses, and play rather dryly.’ The following year, in association with Furman, Karpov continued his steady ascent to the heights of chess mastery. After winning a USSR Championship semi-final (+9=8), there followed a worthy performance in the very strong 39th USSR Championship (Leningrad, September-October 1971): 1. Savon — 15 out of 21; 2-3. Smyslov and Tal - 13V2; 4. Karpov — 13 (+7-2=12), etc. However, he was dissatis¬ fied with his play and complained of ill luck: blunders in his games with Vaganian and Smys¬ lov (Volume 2y Game No.117), a squandered overwhelming advantage against Savon (in his 210 Anatoly the Twelfth time-trouble!) and so on. "No one “made me a present” of even half a point in this tourna¬ ment, whereas I gave many away.’ Despite tiredness (he had been playing for the entire second half of the year), Anatoly did not miss an opportunity to test himself in a rare super-tournament of 18 grandmasters — the Alekhine Memorial (Moscow, November- December 1971). ‘At the opening ceremony Anatoly couldn’t manage to unscrew the head of the souvenir doll in which his tournament number was concealed, and some wit among the spectators exclaimed: “He isn’t very strong... How’s he going to last out in such a tournament?” In the first few days of [this event] there were too many short and colour¬ less draws, but closer to the finish the battle became sharper. Our “young rationalist”, as Karpov was sometimes called, also had to change tactics. At that point he had scored nine draws and only one win — over the Hun¬ garian Lengyel.’ (Roshal) In the 8th round he drew with the world champion Spassky, in the 9th with Tal, and in the 10th with Petrosian. ‘And here I decided: it’s all or nothing!’ recalls Karpov. It was not possible to go on marking time — the oppo¬ nents to come were very difficult And in the next round I was, after all, playing White. And this game, in which I defeated Vlastimil Hort, which was a success in both the competitive, and the creative sense, became the turning point for me in the tournament’ Hort was then one of the strongest players in the world (in the ‘Match of the Century’ he had defeated Polugayevsky on board four), he was ahead of Karpov in the rating list, and at the time of their meeting he was also on ‘plus one’.

Karpov won several pretty and instructive games (given in this book) with the Keres At¬ tack, but from the early 1980s he also had some setbacks here, as well as draws, as in the 1st game of our first match (1984/85), where Black did not experience any opening prob¬ lems. 6.. .£ic6 (6...h6 — Game Nos.83 and 89) 7 g5 &d7 8 ±e3 a6 With the idea of ...Wc7 or ...^xd4 and ...b7-b5.

Or immediately 9 h4, and if 9.. .JLe7 (9...1rc7) - 10 ftii5, 10 WcD, or, as played by Karpov, 10 We2 (Game No, 71). 9.. .£,e7 ‘If 9...h6 my opponent was probably afraid 211 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors of the move I was intending to make - 10 ^ixe6.

JLxd5 16 exd5 ‘Normally one tries to occupy the blockad¬ ing square with a piece,5 writes Karpov, ac¬ knowledging that 16 ®xd5 ‘would have left me with an advantage, since Black’s d-pawn would need to be defended all the time5 (for example, 16...Wb6 17 0-0-0 0-0 18 Igfl etc.), and he explains his choice: ‘But then my e- pawn would in some instances also have re¬ quired guarding, which could have cramped my light-squared bishop. Now, however, this bishop is unrestricted in its movements, espe¬ cially since its black opposite number has al¬ ready left the board.5 16...£\g6 (16...0-0 17 0-0-0 would have con¬ demned Black to passive defence) 17 Ae3 h6! An original move, sharply complicating the situation — ‘risky for both sides!5 At the cost of a pawn Black detains the enemy king in the centre and delays the mobilisation of the white army. However, as long as the centre is closed, it is not apparent how to get at the white king, and Black has just as many problems with his mobilisation. 18 gxh6 &h4+ 19 itfl gxh6 20 Axh6 Af6?! By inventive play Black has almost equal¬ ised, but the tempting idea of playing his bishop to e5 becomes the cause of new diffi¬ culties. This square would be better occupied by the knight, which now remains out of play. And the bishop, by remaining at h4, would have prevented the rook from occupying el, and White would have had to spend time on evacuating his king to safety. Therefore 20...We7! was correct with the intention of ...0-0-0, for example: 21 Jig7 (21 jtg4 is parried by 21...4ie5!) 21...Sh7 22 Jtd4 Jtf6 (now this is quite appropriate, since Black sets up an active defence, where even the rook at h7 will be useful) 23 Jtxf6 Wxf6 24 ‘sfecl 0-0-0 with equality, or 23 Bel Ae5! 24 jLg4 212 Anatoly the Twelfth Sxh2 25 ®xh2 Jlxh2 26 Sxe7+ <i?xe7 21 4?d2 Af4+ with a drawn ending. 21 c3 £e5?! Again 21...We7! was better, with the same idea of 22 Jtg4 £se5l, and if 23 <4?c2 (no bene¬ fit is gained by 23 h3 £ic4! or 23 Bel Jth4 24 Se2 Sg8), then 23...Sxh6! 24 ®xh6 ^xg4 25 Sxg4 We2+ 26 *b3 WbS+ 27 Bb4 (27 4>a3 Wc5+) 27...Wxd5+ 28 <4)a4 a5! with a danger¬ ous counterattack. 22 Jth5 is possible (in or¬ der after 22...£}e5 to calmly reply 23 <4)c2), but here Black sacrifices a second pawn — 22.. .0-0-0! 23 JLxg6 fxg6 24 Sxg6, and after 24.. .5dg8 25 HxgS Bxg8 26 <4>c2 1^4+ 27 #d3 Sg2+ 28 ±d2 #a4+! 29 b3 #h4 it is hard for White to convert his material advan- tage. 22 Sg4! ‘A multi-purpose move!5 (Dvoretsky). For the moment the h2-pawn does not concern Karpov — it is more important not to allow the activation of the black queen. After 22 <4)c2?! ®h4! 23 Ae3 #e4+! 24 ±d3 Wa4+ 25 b3 Wa5 vulnerable points would have appeared in White’s position, and in defending them he would lose his advantage. ‘After 22 ig5 Wb6 23 ±e3 Wc7 I would not have achieved much at all,’ thinks Karpov. But 23 sbc2! (23 Sg2!P Dvoretsky) is more energetic: 23...Sxh2 24 Shi Wf2 25 Bxh2 ®xh2 26 Sfl with dangerous pressure. This looks no worse than the continuation in the game, but it leads to a more clarified position where, from the practical point of view, it is easier for Black to defend (26...^fB, ...Se8 etc.). 22.. .«f6! ‘22...Jtxh2 was comparatively best, re¬ establishing material equality.’ (Karpov). But after 23 <4)c2 Black has a difficult position: ‘23...£ie5? leads to the loss of a piece — 24 Sg2 (24...#h4 25 Hxh2 Wxh2 26 AbS+), while if 23...^d7, then 24 Sfl is strong’ (Dvoretsky), or 24 Be4+! £ie5 (24...Jte5 25 Jlg4 f5 26 Wg5\ ^e7 27 ±h5+ 4>d8 28 Sxe5! dxe5 29 d6 with crushing threats) 25 Bhl HT5 26 Jtd3 with a powerful attack, or if 23...Jte5* then 24 Sfl Wd7 25 Se4 etc. 23 h4! ‘Black was hoping for 23 <A)c2? <£k7! 24 JLe3 Sxh2 or 24 Jtg5 ®f5+. But now neither 23.. .0-0-0 nor 23...^xh4 is possible on ac¬ count of 24 Jtg5.’ (Dvoretsky) 23...#f5! The queen has nevertheless broken free, and it turns out that the opponent’s attacking pieces themselves require defence. The white queen is literally tom in two: it has to guard both the d5-pawn, and the bishop at h6. It also cannot move far away from the king, which is stuck in the centre and is preventing the last reserve, the rook at al, from coming into play, which would immediately change the course of the play. The scenario of this game is rather unusual: for a long time individual soloists perform on 213 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the stage, while the main forces of both sides merely observe what is happening. Why then did Black lose this strange batde? Simply be¬ cause at the decisive moment, when seriously short of time, he suddenly forgot to mobilise his ‘spectators’... 24 2b4! ‘An excellent square for the rook!’ (Kar¬ pov). It would appear that 24 fia4 too is strong, also preventing queenside castling (24...0-0-0? 25 Ag4) and in the event of 24...Wd7 25 fib4! gaining an important tempo for <i?c2. But after 24...^e7! 25 Jte3 Hg8 26 Ab5+ (26 Sfecl 2g3!) 26...*f8 27 Ah6+ ±gl the situation would have become more com¬ plicated. 24...itf6? Losing control of the f4-square, which White prompdy uses as a staging post and consolidates his position. Black did not have equality in any case, but after 24...fig8 25 jtd3 (25 Sxb7? ®tf4; 25 Wg5!? £ie7 26 Wxf5 ^xf5 27 Ag5 f6 is unclear) 25...Wh3! 26 <4>c2 Skh4 or 24...^e7 25 Ag5 h6 26 1x3 Ag3 27 h5 ^ixd5 he would at least have regained the pawn and retained some practical counter¬ chances. 25 h5 (driving back the knight and at the same time making his passed pawn more de- fendable) 25..(25...£k5? 26 2f4) 26 2f4! An obstinate rook! After 26 Hff4?! (to quickly activate the pieces at the cost of the d5-pawn) there could have followed 26.. .fixh6! 27 Wxh6 ^xd5 28 Sg4 (28 Bxb7 We4!) 28...0-0-0 29 ttd2 He8 with a danger¬ ous initiative for the exchange. 26.. .®e5 The culminating moment of the battle has been reached. 27 Hf3? The rook displays miracles of manoeuvra¬ bility, creating or, on the contrary, parrying one threat after another. But it is still working .in isolation, and the undefended state of White’s queenside demands extreme accuracy of him! By leaving his h5-pawn undefended for an instant, he throws away his advantage. Meanwhile — a fact not mentioned by the commentators! — the rook had some better moves: 27 Sfl, 27 Hf2 or even the extrava¬ gant 27 Ha4. Say, after 27 fifl Black’s prob¬ lems are not solved by 27...ttxh6 28 ®xh6 £tf5 in view of 29 fixf5 Hbtf5 30 We3+ 31 HT3, when he remains a pawn down. And in the event of 27...0-0-0 28 Jtf4! (but not 28 <4>c2 Bxh6! 29 Ag4+ <ib8 30 Wxh6 We4+ with a draw) 28...Hfxd5 29 Hbtd5 ^\xd5 30 Ad2 or 28...We4 29 c4 Hhg8 30 Wd3! Wxd3+ (30...%2 31 *c2) 31 Axd3 ±xb2 32 flbl he has a difficult endgame. 27...^xd5?! Karpov does not comment at all on this time-trouble move. A critical evaluation of it could have destroyed the myth of the com¬ pleteness of the game, which states that the 214 Anatoly the Twelfth winner did not allow the opponent a single saving chance. Karpov wrote that the threat of 28 Jtf4 ‘forced’ Black to follow a dangerous path. But if Hort had castled queenside. White would have had problems with his d5-pawn, with his king, which is blocking in the rook at al, and with the overloading of his queen. ‘After 27...0-0-0! the outcome would have remained unclear. 28 <4>c2? 2xh6 is obviously incorrect. If 28 2d3 there follows 28...fidg8! 29 ±f4 (29 ±e3 tyf - G.K) 29„Mf5 with the unpleasant threat of ...flg2. 28 Jte3 <53xd5 29 Jtd4 Hfe6 is unconvincing, while in the event of 28 Af4 it is not apparent how to cast doubts on the simple 28...Wxh5P (Dvoretsky). Moreover, after 29 c4 Wg6 30 Hfl Wg7 31 ifecl 32 Jte3 S.de8 Black has a comfort¬ able game. 28 2d3! flxh6 (28...£k7? 29 Af4 Iff5(e4) 30 Sxd6) 29 2xd5 (of course, not 29 ttdi6? ±g5 30 ®h7 ^leTh Karpov) 29...®e4 After 29...Hfe6 White had a choice between an attack with material equal — 30 4?c2, finally bringing the al-rook into play, and a prosaic endgame with an extra pawn — 30 Sxd6 Wxd6 31 #xd6 Sd8 32 ttfxd&f jk.xd8 33 <4>c2 etc. 30 2d3! A brilliant practical chance (Be3 is threat¬ ened), which brings instant success. The rook displays enviable efficiency, defeating the en¬ tire hostile army practically on its own! After 30 1§xh6 ®xd5+ 31 4)c2 Black could have defended by 31.Jk.e5 32 tte3 (32 %5?i 33 Jtd3 ®a4+ 34 b3 #a5 with equality) 32.. .0-0-0 or even 31...«ft5+ 32 ±d3 ®£2f 33 #d2 (33 <4>b3 lh6+) 33...«rxd2+ 34 <4>xd2 *e7, and the endgame with opposite- coloured bishops promises a draw. 30.. .1rh1+? A time-trouble catastrophe. 30..38fh7 was essential, for example: 31 Jtg4 (31 flxd6? ^.g5!; nothing is also achieved by 31 Jtf3 ±g5! or 31 #e3+ ±e5) 31...±g5! 32 *h2+ *f8 33 <4)c2 fle8 or 31 4>c2 0-0-0 32 Sfl Se8 33 Jtg4+ &b8 with chances of a successful defence. 31 *c2 Wxal 32 #xh6 Ae5 33 #g5! Preventing queenside castling, threatening Wg8+ and opening the way for the h-pawn. In this hopeless position (if 33...2d8, then 34 <4>b3 or 34 a3) Black lost on time (TO). The game was judged to be the best in the tour¬ nament. Then, after a draw with Tukmakov, the 20- year-old grandmaster gained two more cool- headed wins. In his game with Bronstein, he employed his favourite plan with 6 Jte2 against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Bronstein tried to improve Black’s play compared with the game Geller-Fischer (Volume 2, Game No. 98, note to Black’s 7th move), but without success. On the 23rd move White won a pawn, and at this moment, according to Roshal, above the noise of the press centre everyone heard the quiet and slow voice of Furman: When Tolya is ahead on material, he wins. About this I have no qualms.5 The next day Karpov defeated Korchnoi in good style with Black. After draws with Stein and Smyslov, he beat Savon in the last round and, by catching Leonid Stein, he shared lst-2nd places with him! Regarding this, Botvinnik said in a tele¬ phone conversation to Kotov: ‘Remember this day, 18 December 1971. In our country a new chess star of the first magnitude has ap¬ peared!’ And on the pages of 64 Petrosian too gave a high appreciation of Karpov’s play: ‘I 215 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors like his points, his approach to chess, I like his competitive character, his prudence. I liked the fact that towards the end of the tourna¬ ment he put on speed, having evidently reck¬ oned beforehand that thanks to his youth he would have more strength than those older than him, and with a spurt he overtook many as though they were standing still. I think that today Karpov is our main chess hope — per¬ haps in the next few years he will become the most insurmountable barrier in the path of western players to the world crown/ The FIDE President Max Euwe also called Karpov a probable future chess king. And Anatoly himself, when asked in an interview ‘will you be world champion?’, answered with disarming frankness: ‘Yes, I probably will. Only not in the next four years. There is too much that I don’t yet know.’ Only a couple of weeks had passed, when Karpov set off to the traditional tournament in Hastings (1971/72), where he started with 7 out of 8! Then, after a draw with Black against Gligoric, he won another game and... sensed that his strength was on the wane: To be honest, I was simply worn out.’ After a loss in the 14th round to Korchnoi, ‘by incredible efforts’ he defeated Markland in the decisive game — and he caught his only rival: 1-2. Kar¬ pov and Korchnoi — 11 out of 15; 3-4. Byrne and Mecking — 9V2; 5-6. Gligoric and Najdorf — 8V2; 7-8. Andersson and Unzicker — 8, etc. His next appearance, in the USSR Team Championship (Moscow, March 1972), is memorable for the splendid positional wins with White against Smyslov and Taimanov, and with Black against Stein. In this game Anatoly demonstrated that amazing tenacity and resourcefulness in defence which was later to become famous, and he accurately parried the direct attack of his formidable opponent. Such ingenuity had distinguished Karpov from his very childhood, when he did not yet know any opening theory and often ended up in difficult positions. That same spring a grandiose double-round blitz tournament of the strongest Soviet play¬ ers was held in Moscow. By winning 12 suc¬ cessive games in the second half (against Kholmov, Tal, Stein, Bronstein, Polugayevsky, Taimanov, Balashov etc.), Karpov ended up sharing lst-2nd places with Tukmakov from Odessa. ‘This exhausting event for a long time removed Karpov’s taste for blitz, but he did not forget what for some reason he consid¬ ered to be a failure. When he happened to be in Odessa, he found an opportunity to meet Tukmakov in a blitz match. With the score standing at 0-13 his opponent surrendered...’ (Roshal) Soon Anatoly led the Soviet team in his second Student Olympiad (Graz, August 1972). A year earlier he had played on board three (+7=1), but now he showed himself to be a worthy leader (+5=4). Anatoly Byk- hovsky, the trainer of the USSR youth team, recalls: ‘Those Olympiads genuinely revealed Kar¬ pov for me. In Puerto Rico the ease and ele¬ gance of his play created an indelible impres¬ sion. Usually he was the first to finish his games, after spending not more than an hour on his clock. After losing, his opponents looked somehow perplexed: it appeared that they did not understand at all the ideas and moves of the young grandmaster. In my view, Karpov has such an original playing style, that it is hard even to name his chess predecessor, and this is always an indication of genuine talent... In Graz he played Robert Hubner. We have always found it hard against the West German team, and here Hubner was leading Karpov in the battle for the best result on board one. This was the same Hubner who had been defeated only narrowly in a Candi¬ dates match by Petrosian (and the same Hiib- ner who soon was again to perform brilliantly at the World Olympiad in Skopje). It was a critical encounter in all respects: it was due to determine the order of strength for many years ahead and show how Karpov compared with the leading western grandmaster. Anatoly 216 Anatoly the Twelfth showed that he understood the position both more subtly, and more deeply!’ Such an Acquaintance’ with foreign stars of the new generation was typical of Karpov: before Hubner, I should remind you, he de¬ feated Timman (1967/68), and Andersson (1969), and the ‘chess Pele’ — the future two- times winner of Interzonal tournaments, the Brazilian Henrique Mecking (Hastings 1971/72). He also shone in his first world Olympiad (Skopje, autumn 1972), making the best score on the 1st reserve board (+12—1=2). Tal: ‘This was a genuine “benefit performance” by Ana¬ toly. Only in Skopje did I realise that Karpov was indeed capable of the highest achieve¬ ments. Previously too he had gained excellent results, but in the creative sense his play did not impress me. Now I admire Karpov’s games purely chess-wise. At the Olympiad, on his own he played almost as many such games as all the other team members put together. And therefore I find it impossible to choose which of his games was the best’ By a decision of FIDE, Karpov, as world junior champion, was admitted into the 1973 Interzonal tournament without having to qual¬ ify. This relieved him of the need to play in the Zonal, 40th USSR Championship, and together with Petrosian and Keres he set off to a super-tournament in San Antonio (No- vember-December 1972), arranged on the wave of the chess boom reigning in the USA after Fischer’s victory in the match with Spassky. There the young grandmaster, ini¬ tially competing with Larsen and Keres, again started with 7 out of 8!

'Such moves are very difficult to find!’ writes Karpov, and he very intelligibly explains the reasons for his decision: White has an obvious spatial advantage. In order to increase his positional gains, he needs to find a clear plan for regrouping his pieces. Here are my basic thoughts regarding the po¬ sition: 1) Black has only one obvious weakness — the c5-pawn; an attack on it should be ar¬ ranged quickly — this will enable the manoeu¬ vrability of the opponent’s pieces to be re¬ stricted; 2) the best square for the king is f3, where it is not liable to be checked, it over¬ protects the bishop at g4, and it opens the gl- a7 diagonal for the bishop and queen battery and the 2nd rank for rook manoeuvres; 3) 219 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors White must fight to control the h-file and de¬ velop an initiative on the kingside; at a favour¬ able moment he can switch the entire weight of the struggle to the opposite flank, exploit¬ ing the great mobility of his forces. White’s last move complies with all these conditions.’ 42.. .£>b6 43 Sh2 #e7? Black does not yet sense the danger to his queenside and he tries to fight for control of the h-file (44 Whl WdS), instead of denying the white knight the possibility of transferring via b3 to a5 — 43...a5! and ...a5-a4. 44<£ib3 Now that this knight is paralysing Black’s queenside, his resources for resisting quickly evaporate. 44.. .*c7 45 if3! £id7 46 a3! bxa3 47 Ha2! The planned regrouping has been carried out, and it transpires that the black king, by fleeing to the queenside, has gone from the frying pan into the fire. 47.. .Bh4 48 Sxa3 48...Hgh8 Clever tactics — 48...^f6 49 gxf6 gxf6 — do not help: 50 Sa5!

Then, however, Anatoly obviously became tired: after making an oversight in a good po¬ sition, he lost to Portisch. Then in the 13th round, still the sole leader, he was unable to beat Kaplan, and at the finish he spared Meck- ing, although before the game the latter had been Very nervous’ and looked at him Tike a hunted wild animal’. Even so the result was not bad: 1-3. Karpov, Petrosian and Portisch — IOV2 out of 15; 4. Gligoric — 10; 5. Keres — 914; 6-7. Hort and Suttles - 9; 8-9. Larsen and Mecking — 8V2, etc. On the day of the concluding round Kar¬ pov met Fischer for the first time. The organ¬ isers invited the world champion to visit the tournament and, on learning that he had been delayed, they even postponed the start of the round by 15 minutes. TVow Fischer is late not only for his own games, but also for those of others,’ Petrosian remarked. We sat and waited. Fischer appeared together with Euwe, and then Fischer came up onto the stage and shook hands with each of the players. That is the sum total of my impressions,’ writes Kar¬ pov in Chess is my Life, but in the book Sestra moya Kaissa (Caissa is my sister, 1990) he adds: ‘He appeared on the last day, which was not too fortunate. The winners — and I was one of them — peacefully split the points and Fischer, who sat in the audience for no more than quarter of an hour, understood the situation and disappeared.’ It is possible that already then, at the end of 1972, not only Botvinnik, Petrosian and Tal, but also Fischer himself, after carefully observing Karpov at the board, sensed that an intervention in the battle for the chess crown would soon be made by this very ‘se¬ rious boyT 220 Anatoly the Twelfth This is not my Cycle' While preparing for his first and, as it later transpired, his only. Interzonal tournament, Karpov played in Budapest the spring of 1973 (+4=11; 2nd place after Geller) and in an un¬ usual match-tournament of three USSR teams, where he beat Spassky and Taimanov (+2=2) on board one. That year, taking into account the rise in the number of strong players, FIDE for the first time divided the Interzonal stage into two separate tournaments, and from then on, in order to qualify for the Candidates, one had to finish not in the first six, but in the first three places. The division was made by rating and led to an obvious mismatch: in Petropolis, Brazil, there was only one of the six candi¬ dates from the previous cycle — Geller, whereas in Leningrad (June 1973) there were five: Korchnoi, Larsen, Hiibner, Taimanov and Uhlmann. There was also the formidable Tal, who had just won five tournaments in succession, as well as the young Karpov, who was enjoying constant successes. And only three places?! However, as Tal wisely re¬ marked, if the task of finishing in the first three proves too difficult, what is the sense in contending for the tide of world champion? Karpov set himself the audacious task of winning the Interzonal tournament (which promised a comparatively weaker opponent in the first Candidates match) or at least of oc¬ cupying one of the qualifying places. Many years later, when bans were lifted, he revealed in the press that he had prepared for this tournament together with Korchnoi: eOn one occasion some friends called un¬ expectedly, we had a pleasant, jovial evening, and someone suggested: let’s try and guess who will play in the final Candidates match, and when the final pair has been decided, we’ll open the envelopes. I remember that I wrote: Spassky-Petrosian. I was sure that they were the strongest of the Candidates... I didn’t put myself down, because I genuinely didn’t think that it was my cycle. Firsdy, I had hardly any experience of playing at this level, and sec¬ ondly, I thought that for the moment my main opponents were objectively stronger than me. Of course, these forecasts were immediately forgotten by everyone, including myself. But when the final pair — Korchnoi and I — had been determined, our friend, who had kept the forecasts, came and showed them all. In only one did Korchnoi-Karpov appear, and it was written in Korchnoi’s familiar hand...’ This shows enviable foresight, but first the two cKs’ had to overcome the Interzonal bar¬ rier! In this tournament Karpov was seconded not only by Furman, but also the Muscovite Yuri Razuvaev, with whom, like Balashov, he had been acquainted since the times of the Botvinnik school. After the Student Olympiad in Puerto Rico (1971) Anatoly had asked his team colleagues to help him and Furman in the forthcoming world championship qualify¬ ing cycle. It should be said that the two Yuri Sergeevichs — Balashov and Razuvaev, now well-known grandmasters and trainers, were among the most erudite players of the young generation. Thus was bom the training staff of the future world champion eAt the start, Karpov’s play perhaps lacked the brilliance that distinguished Korchnoi’s play,’ wrote Alexander Kotov, the chief arbiter of the Leningrad Interzonal. ‘His wins did not come in series, but as ones interspersed with half points. The giants did not succumb to his blows, although he claimed quite a number of victims. Karpov played slighdy cautiously, did not take risks, and at times avoided unclear complications. Well, such play is a sure way of achieving success in qualifying events. But when, by the will of fate, complications arose on the board, Karpov was able to figure them out with the precision of a cybernetic ma¬ chine. Here he was prepared to sacrifice, and he was not afraid of any sharpening of the position.’ In the first six rounds he won with Black against Estevez, Tukmakov and Cuellar (after parrying the opponent’s fierce attack with dif- 22 1 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ficuity in time-trouble), and drew with Hiibner (in a tough, fascinating struggle), Korchnoi and Taimanov. At that moment the leading group looked like this: Larsen — 5x/2 out of 6; Byrne and Korchnoi — 5; Karpov — 4%; Kuzmin — 4. It was time to actuate the white pieces — Karpov’s most dangerous weapon throughout his career! Game 52 A.Karpov-G.Kuzmin Interzonal Tournament, Leningrad 1973, 7th round' French Defence C09 1 e4 e6 (to avoid being tortured in the Span¬ ish, Gennady Kuzmin chose a defence that he rarely employed) 2 d4 d5 3 4bd2 At that time this quiet Tarrasch-Geller move brought Karpov almost 100% success. But his matches with Korchnoi (1974 and 1978) showed that it is not at all easy for White to win against the position with an iso¬ lated pawn, and from 1982 Anatoly also began employing 3 ^lc3. 3...c5 Previously Kuzmin had played 3...dxe4. On this occasion he decided to improve Black’s play in comparison with Karpov’s games against Krogius (Kuybyshev 1970) and Va- ganian (Budapest 1973). But here he was unlucky — this was his ‘opponent’s territory’: Karpov and Furman had been engaged in solving the secrets of the 3 ^d2 variation since the start of the 1970s. 4 exd5 exd5 5 4bgf3 (in Baguio, Karpov switched to 5 Jtb5+) 5...4bc6 (5...a6 — Game No. 15) 6 Jtb5 ±66 7 dxc5 ±xc5 8 0-0 4bge7 9 £ib3 ±66 This move, later employed by Korchnoi, was comparatively unexplored at that time.

Missing a chance to achieve a good game. This move indicates an inadequate knowledge of the subtleties of such positions: the queen stands better at b6! In analysis after the game 11.. .jtg4 12 jtg3 Jtxg3 13 hxg3 ®b6! 14 jtd3 etc. was examined. The opponent’s plan appealed to Kuzmin, and in his 13th round game with Uhlmann he improved White’s play with 12 Jle2! — as Karpov himself played six months later (Game No.53). But games from the following year showed that the immediate ll...Wb6! is better, when Black has no opening problems, for example: 12 Jtd3 a5 13 a4 £if5! 14 AxfS ±xf5 15 &g3 jtxg3 16 hxg3 JLe4 with equality (Balashov- Gulko, Moscow 1974). 12 ±q3 JLxg3 13 hxg3 ±g4 In positions with an isolated d5-pawn it is useful for Black to exchange this bishop — so that at least it should not be transformed into a ‘large pawn’, standing at e6. 14 Sel Sad8 15 c3 ®b6 (finally the queen stands where it needs to be) 16 $Ld3 16.. .^g6 Avoiding creating any weaknesses, but also not preventing the opponent from strengthen¬ ing his position. With the typical manoeuvre 16... Jth5 (and if 17 Wc2, then 17...iLg6) Black would also have retained hopes of gradually dampening White’s slight initiative by accurate and patient defence. ‘Of course, 16...d4 would have been an¬ swered by 17 c4,’ writes Karpov. But then after 17...^g6 White could have gradually lost his entire advantage! I think that in fact there would have followed 17 JLxh7+! 18 Jtd3 dxc3 19 bxc3, when Black has no compensa¬ tion for the pawn (if 19...^f5?l, then 20 Wd2! is strong, with the idea of 20...^xg3 21 HT4 or 20..Jtxf3 21 gxf3 4ixg3 22 <4>g2!). 17 ®c2 ±xf3 18 gxf3 Sd6? Seemingly active and consistent: by defend¬ ing his knight, Black ensures the advance of his h7-pawn to h4. But if one looks ahead, it will be seen that this entire operation is simply a waste of time. In such structures you should get rid of the isolated pawn at the first convenient opportu¬ nity, and now was precisely such a moment — 18.. .d4!, since 19 c4?! is unfavourable on ac¬ count of 19...^ce5! Karpov considers 19 £4 dxc3 20 bxc3 ‘with an interesting position, in which White’s pawns restrict the black knights on both wings.’ But, in my view, after 20.. .1fe8 21 Jte4 £if8 22 He3 and Hael White’s advantage is comparatively slight. 19 f4 Ifd8 It is good to defend the ‘isolani’ indirectly — increasing the activity of the pieces and de¬ ploying the rooks on adjacent files. But here 223 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors both rooks are propping up the d5-pawn, which at the moment nothing is attacking! Alas, 19...d4?! is now too late on account of 20 c4, and after 20...£>b4 21 lrd2 £>xd3 22 ttxd3 Wd8 23 Se4 the d-pawn is lost 20 a3! . The effect of this quiet move is equivalent to a thunder clap: Black finally loses any hope of playing ...d5-d4 and is left without counter¬ play. Whereas White’s plan is clear: he will transfer his knight to f3, double rooks on the e-file, and then, according to circumstances, advance his f-pawn and his queenside pawns/ (Karpov) 20...h5?! Black’s chances are associated with play in the centre and on the queenside, but definitely not on the kingside. However, after 20..,a5 21 4^d2 and ^f3 he would also have been a long way from equalising. 21 *g2 h4 22 Ie2! Karpov is in his element! The direct 22 Hhl after 22...hxg3 23 fxg3 fie8! would have obliged White to neutralise an invasion on the e-file. 22 ^d2 looks quite good, with the idea of 22...h3+ 23 4>gl! and £>£3. But Karpov’s decision is far more effective. Realising that his opponent is labouring under an illusion, he does not hurry and in the first instance does not allow him even the slightest activity. In addition, he takes control of the e-file, along which the decisive blow will be landed. It is interesting that the invasion along the h-file remained only a threat (although one that Black had to reckon with!). 22.. .4hf8 23 £kJ2 ih6 24 £>f3 hxg3 25 fxg3 4hd7 25...d4 26 c4 would not have eased Black’s fate, for example: 26...4M7 27 b4!, 26...a5 27 flael, 26...Src5 27 £5!, or 26...#a5 27 c5! and Sael. 26 lael The two sides have completed their planned regroupings. And it turns out that White’s pressure on the e-file is very real, whereas Black’s possession of the h-file does not promise anything, since his rook is unsup¬ ported. Not having found the time for activity on the queenside, Black has condemned his queen to inaction. His pieces are scattered in disorder, whereas White’s forces are ready to attack the king’s fortress. This is where a dif¬ ference in positional understanding tells, even among grandmasters. 26.. .15 Other moves are no better. 27 g4! When clear-cut aims appeared, already in his youth Karpov was able to switch quickly from thinking in patterns and schemes to con¬ crete calculation. Some of his decisions may seem unexpected (for example, the exchange of queens at the very end), but it is all calcu¬ lated with exceptional accuracy. 27../tc7 Black has nothing on which to base any 224 Anatoly the Twelfth counterplay, and his position is hopeless: 27...£k5 (27...g6?l 28 g5 and Axgfl) 28 kf5\ lfb3 (28...#c7 29 g5 fih8 30 <^g3, as in the game) 29 ®xb3 4htb3 30 Jld7! f6 31 fie8+ Bxe8 32 fixe8+ st?f7 33 g5 or 30...g6 31 He8+ fixe8 32 Bxe8+ <4>g7 33 Jlxc6 bxc6 34 He7 and wins. 28 g5 Sh8 29 4>g3! £)c5 30 Af5 g6 31 b4! 31.. .£)e4+ After 31...gxf5 (31...£\d7 32 Axg6!) 32 bxc5 the black king is unable to escape: 32...d4 33 Bh2!

A model of strategic planning, based on an assessment of the genuinely significant fea¬ tures of the position. The next day Karpov faced a difficult test — ‘Spanish torture5 in his game with Tal, who was eager to make amends for his extremely poor start (the ex-world champion was unwell, but he categorically rejected all suggestions by the doctors to withdraw from the tourna¬ ment). The adjourned position — two rooks and a passed a-pawn against rook, bishop and knight, plus three pawns each on the kingside — looked dangerous for Black, but he was able to save it on the resumption. Anatoly prompdy pointed out the strongest move for White, found in his sleep(l), which, however, was also insufficient to win. After this game the American master Zuckerman, Byrne’s second and a friend of Fischer, declared: ‘If Karpov can save such positions, it’s altogether impossible to win against him!’ But in the words of Karpov, his main rival Korchnoi ‘reproached Tal, without foundation, for not wanting to win a superior adjourned posi¬ tion...’ Then Karpov crushed Quinteros (one of the five Best game’ prizes) and, having scored 7 out of 9, moved into second place. A point ahead of him was Korchnoi, who had just defeated Larsen (Game No.20) and Byrne. But he only needed to stumble in the 12th round, and Karpov, after beating Uhlmann in a diffi¬ cult struggle, caught up with him! In the 13th round the young grandmaster won another ‘Spanish duel’ against Gligoric, but Korchnoi also won. In the 14th round Korchnoi drew with Smejkal, who had now warmed up, but Karpov defeated Rukavina and for the first time became the sole leader — 11 out of 14! ‘The round-by-round movements of Korchnoi and Karpov resemble a cycle race, when two racers are ahead for the whole dis¬ tance and at the same time change places, handing each other the lead in turn.’ (Kotov) In the 15th round it was Karpov’s turn to draw — and again there were two leaders! Two rounds before the finish the battle for a place in the cherished three had become extremely sharp: Karpov and Korchnoi had 11 Vi points, Byrne - 11 and Smejkal - IOV2. In the 16th round Korchnoi and Byrne won their games, 225 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors while Karpov had Black against Smejkal, who had staggered the public with a series of seven wins in the middle of the tournament. An anx¬ ious, nervy encounter! Smejkal had a danger¬ ous initiative, but he spent too much time in thought and in severe time-trouble he first lost his advantage, and then on the 39th move he blundered a pawn. On the resumption Karpov methodically exploited another error by his distressed opponent and won a memorable endgame with queen and opposite-coloured bishops. The question of the leading trio was de¬ cided: Karpov, Korchnoi and Byrne, who was half a point behind (a major triumph for the 45-year-old American grandmaster!). But who would take first place? In the last round Byrne agreed a 13-move draw with Uhlmann, and now it was all in the hands of the two ‘Ks*. Both had White: Karpov against the Filipino Torre, and Korchnoi against Hiibner. Before the games Anatoly received a pro¬ posal from his rival that both games should be agreed drawn and that first place should be ‘rightly* shared. T, of course, rejected this “Korchnoi variation”, which considerably angered him/ Karpov recalls. "The proposal was unpleasant for me: in our country such “tricks” are vigorously condemned. I won quickly against Torre and went off to analyse with him. Later Korchnoi arrived and loudly (for everyone) and maliciously (for me) an¬ nounced: “Well, I was forced to win against Hiibner.” Now I realise: he and I would have become enemies much sooner, if he had not won that last game in the Interzonal.* The outcome of the gripping Leningrad race was as follows: 1-2. Karpov and Korchnoi — 13V4 out of 17; 3. Byrne — I2V2; 4. Smejkal — 11; 5-6. Hiibner and Larsen — 10; 7. Kuzmin — 9Vz; 8-10. Gligoric, Taimanov and Tal — 8V2, etc. Incidentally, Karpov neverthe¬ less achieved his highest aim: in the autumn, at the drawing of lots for the Candidates matches, he was arbitrarily awarded first place in the Interzonal, thanks to which he avoided a quarter-final meeting with Spassky or Petro¬ sian and was given Polugayevsky as his oppo¬ nent. But Korchnoi too did not complain of his fate, being paired against Mecking, the winner of the other Interzonal tournament in Brazil. It is amusing that Mecking announced that summer: ‘Only Karpov and I can take the tide of world champion from Fischer!* On learning of this, Karpov thought: ‘Indeed, it wouldn’t be bad to meet Mecking in the final Candi¬ dates match... But this was improbable. I thought that we were both still rather too in¬ experienced to get through to the final match. All the major international tournaments that I had played up till then could be counted on the fingers of one hand, and this, of course, was very little to be a real contender for the title of world champion. It was more realistic to pin my hopes on the next three-year cycle. This is why I said to journalists: “This is not my cycle.” * At that time Korchnoi also gave a forecast of the forthcoming events at the chess sum¬ mit, which as usual was very interesting from the professional point of view: ‘It is unlikely that I will be able to win the Candidates event. Among my rivals there are some “awkward** opponents. In general I think that the generation defeated by Fischer can no longer successfully oppose him. This is a task for the young. Can Karpov cope with it? I don’t know. Karpov’s last few appear¬ ances have shown that, as a tournament fighter, he is not inferior to Fischer... Karpov is improving from one tournament to the next. In one of my statements I said that in this cycle no one would be able to win against Fischer. For this Karpov has as yet insufficient experience and knowledge. Perhaps he be¬ lieved me and therefore he stated that this is “not his cycle”? But in the Interzonal tourna¬ ment he fought for the highest place and played more maturely than previously. Karpov is becoming a great tournament fighter, taking risks when necessary, and capable of playing 226 Anatoly the Twelfth for a win in every game. At the same time he is very practical and does not make any bad mistakes. His play now resembles that of Spassky in his best years — composure in every encounter, evenness in all stages of the game, and a lack of obvious errors.’ literally a week after the tournament, Korchnoi and Karpov were already playing for the USSR team in the European Team Championship (Bath, July 1973), where Ana¬ toly scored the best result on board four (+4=2). The next test was the 41st USSR Championship (Moscow, October 1973), the strongest for many years: 1. Spassky — 11 Vz out of 17; 2-6. Karpov, Korchnoi, Kuzmin, Petrosian and Polugayevsky — lOVi; behind them Geller, Keres, Taimanov, Tal, Tukma- kov, Smyslov etc. Tor the first time I set my sights on the ti¬ de of USSR Champion: my consistent and good results had given me the right to such an aim,’ Karpov recalls. But I was prevented from taking first place by a certain ambiva¬ lence. On the one hand, I wanted to win the championship, but on the other hand it was impossible to “open up” completely, since looming ahead was the quarter-final Candi¬ dates match with Polugayevsky. It was neces¬ sary to economise on my strength and my openings.’ This was Tal’s opinion: ‘Karpov made this tournament into a kind of training ground. The young grandmaster has frequendy been reproached for his insufficiendy broad open¬ ing repertoire (similar claims were made about Fischer in 1970-71). I think that in a number of games in this championship the Leningrad grandmaster deliberately went in for unfamil¬ iar set-ups, trying to master them, so to speak, while in motion, and this was the direction he pursued, endeavouring not to be diverted from his set program.’ And another important observation by Karpov: By, contrast, Spassky peddled furi¬ ously. He played flat-out, not saving any theo¬ retical discoveries for the Candidates matches, and generously revealing his plans in a number of variations, admitting that before the Candi¬ dates matches he had to experience his strength. But I think that Spassky’s victory in the championship was not really so convinc¬ ing and promising for him. The ex-world champion had a losing position against me, he could have lost by force to Korchnoi, and he had a difficult position against Kuzmin... Had he lost to any of us, the winner would have shared first place with him.’ An uncommonly sober assessment of the play of a dangerous future opponent, whose triumph in the na¬ tional championship provoked general admi¬ ration! The last stage of his preparations for the match with Polugayevsky was a tournament in Madrid (November-December 1973), where Anatoly played together with Furman: Bot- vinnik was against me making this journey. He thought that the better I performed in Madrid, the worse things would be for me in the Can¬ didates matches. I was of a different opinion. And I wasn’t mistaken.’ The young challenger started with 2Vi out of 3 (wins over Pomar and Anders son), but then made a series of draws: *1 played, so to speak, on technique, without especially giving my all’. Four rounds before the finish the sole lead has been assumed by Uhlmann — 8V2 out of 11, and behind him were Karpov, Furman, Tukmakov and Hort on IV2, In this situation there is no need to explain the competitive importance of the following game with the experienced German grandmaster.

And 227 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors even Karpov, for all his amazing skill in accu¬ mulating small pluses and transforming them into a more substantial advantage, would hardly have achieved such successes without the ‘help5 of his opponents. But these mis¬ takes, as in the present game, were sometimes so imperceptible, that it was possible to find them only after a scrupulous analysis. 5 £}gf3 ^c6 6 ±d6 7 dxc5 ±xc5 8 0-0 ^ge7 9 £}b3 ±d6 10 ±g5 0-0 11 The time for 11 Bel!

The aim of this advance does not immedi¬ ately become clear. White is not thinking about an attack — he is preparing for the end¬ game! ‘Such moves afford me the greatest satis¬ faction: White succeeds in seeing into the fu¬ ture. And in the immediate future the game transposes into a double-rook ending with light-squared bishops. The mobility of the black bishop is restricted by its own pawn at d5, and now my pawn at g4 will cramp it still further. It may be objected: but you are plac¬ ing a pawn on a square of the colour of your own bishop! This is indeed so, but my bishop is working along different diagonals.’ (Karpov) 22...£>xd4? Karpov’s judgement, which is of methodo¬ logical value, could have encountered serious counter-arguments, if Black had not hurried with exchanges, but followed Karpov’s own recommendation: The preparatory 22...fiac8 would have been technically better.’ It would appear that in this way he could have maintained approximate equality: 23 ^f5 (23 B JLg6) 23...±xf5 24 gxfi d4! 25 Wg4 £ia7 26 JLfl Wf6, or 23 flcl £ixd4 24 ®xd4 Wxd4 25 cxd4 ‘SPfB with good drawing chances. 23 #xd4! #xd4 24 cxd4 Iac8 25 f3 Aq6 26 2e7! b6 According to Karpov, It was probably time to decide on active measures with 26...fic2.’ However, after 27 flael!

Practically shutting the rook out of the game — and this is sufficient for Karpov to win. He does not fear the invasion of the other rook: on its own, or even with the sup¬ port of the bishop, it can only give a few checks, pick up a couple of pawns, whereas the united pair of white rooks will weave a mating net. ‘If now 28...fic2, then very unpleasant for 229 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Black is 29 2e2 2xe2 30 Jtxe2 2d6 31 JLbS followed by the advance of White’s king to the centre, which enables him to achieve domina¬ tion despite the limited material.’ (Karpov). But it seems to me that this variation would leave Black real saving chances: Sl-.^fS 32 <^£2 JLc2 33 2c7 Jth7 34 4?e3 g5I, blocking the king’s path to the centre. It is not apparent how White can breach this fortress. I should add that after the only move 28...Sc2!

Af5+ 47 *g3 2xe7 48 2xe7 etc. An excellent finish — 3V2 out of 4, including a win with Black in the last round, enabled the 22-year-old Soviet grandmaster to become the sole winner for the first time of a major interna¬ tional tournament: 1. Karpov — 11 out of 15; 2. Tukmakov — IOV2; 3. Furman — 10; 4-5. Hort and Uhlmann — 9Vi; 6-7. Andersson and Por- tisch — 9, etc. At the closing ceremony, together with the first pri2e he also received his first chess ‘Oscar’. Symptomatic, wouldn’t you agree? Before that the ‘Oscar’ had been won only by Spassky (1968 and 1969) and Fischer (1970,1971 and 1972). Of course, Fischer continued to observe the rise of the new star with unremitting attention, studying the style and habits of his potential opponent. Highly eloquent is the testimony of Tal, who together with Karpov gave simulta¬ neous displays at the world youth and students’ festival in Berlin in the summer of 1973: ‘After one of the displays the organisers drew our attention to a youthful-looking woman, who all the tipe had been beside Karpov’s boards with a camera in her hands. It turned out to be the mother of Robert Fischer. At the request of her son, she had taken a few photographs. The world cham¬ pion wanted to get to know Karpov a little better, since he thought that he would be his opponent in the 1975 world championship match. I have to admit that at the time I found this hard to believe, but Fischer proved more far-sighted...’ 230 Anatoly the Twelfth Duel of the Debutants Karpov’s first opponent in the Candidates matches — the 39-year-old Lev Polugayevsky, twice USSR Champion and the winner of many international tournaments — was also making his debut in competitions at such a high leveL However, in contrast to Karpov, he did have some match experience: two matches for the title of USSR Champion (with Alexan¬ der Zaitsev and Petrosian) and the clash with Hort in the ‘Match of the Century’. Even so, according to Tal, most of the experts pre¬ dicted victory for the younger contestant, but., after a very tough struggle. Polugayevsky himself rated his own chances rather modestly, but he prepared with all his might: 1 was not particularly happy about the opponent who had “fallen” to me. Although Karpov had said that it was not yet “his” Candidates cycle, his amazing successes and his enormous talent, gathering strength with every day, demonstrated that in the chess world he was an exceptional phenomenon. Perhaps it was for this reason that my attitude to the match was excessively serious. Leaving myself practically no time for relaxation, I de¬ voted all my time to opening preparation. (Later I endeavoured to avoid this mistake.) I knew that Karpov never declined a theoretical duel, since he believed in himself, his analysis, and his ability to solve the most unexpected problems at the board. And I decided to spring a surprise on him: as Black to play “my” Sicilian schemes, but as White — instead of my favourite 1 c4 to switch to 1 d4, and to battle in the main variation of the Nimzo- Indian Defence, which was firmly established in Karpov’s repertoire.’ A curious touch: When Polugayevsky was preparing for the match with Karpov he looked through about 250 of his games, and found much in common between Karpov and Fischer. In the opening they both play “straight chess”. What did Polugayevsky imply by this definition? Both Fischer and Karpov are ready to engage in a critical theoretical dis¬ pute, since they believe in the correctness of their opening approach — they usually employ only continuations that have been carefully considered and analysed in variations selected beforehand. At the same time the technique of Fischer and Karpov is exceptionally fine, and it is hard to find flaws in it, although they probably play more quickly than all the other strongest grandmasters.’ (Roshal) Karpov also had his match strategy: ‘In Furman’s opinion, before the match with Po¬ lugayevsky I already had a sufficiently deep, although perhaps not particularly extensive knowledge of the openings. Our “plan of campaign” was briefly as follows: Po¬ lugayevsky likes positions of a calculating na¬ ture — don’t allow him to obtain them on the board. The narrowness of the opponent’s opening repertoire simplified our task.’ As a result, in this match — uniquely of all the quarter-finals — the theoretical discussion took place in only two variations: a popular line of the Najdorf Variation in the Sicilian (6 Ae2 e5 7 £lb3 ±e7 8 0-0 ±e6 9 £4 Wc7 10 a4 ^3bd7 11 <4’hl) and the Nimzo-Indian De¬ fence (4 e3 0-0 5 kd3 c5 6 £)£3 d5 7 0-0 dxc4 8 JLxc4 9 a3 Jla5). And although famil- iar middlegame positions arose, serious thought by the two players, sometimes leading to dubious decisions, began already in the opening. Well, this was the pre-computer era, when home analysis of the early middlegame, with rare outstanding exceptions, was largely of an illustrative character. Nevertheless, this ‘heavyweight battle’ enabled a number of typi¬ cal positions in the Sicilian Defence to be looked at anew and made a valuable contribu¬ tion to its theory. In the early stages of the match (Moscow, January-February 1974) there was a difficult, equal struggle: the first three games ended in draws. By the new FIDE rules, adopted under the influence of Fischer, they now played to a definite number of wins; in the quarter-final — to three (but not more than 16 games). Botvinnik: ‘At first, Karpov did not appre- 231 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors date where his opponent’s weaknesses were. But he employed one of the strongest features of his nature — his self-education program, and he reorganised himself. The point is that Polugayevsky is strong when he knows what has to be done. But when the plan is not clear, and the game drags out, Polugayevsky is weaker. After the 4th game Karpov gained in confidence.’ Game 54 A.Karpov-L.Polugayevsky Candidates Match, Moscow 1974, 4th game Sicilian Defence B92 1 e4 c5 2 £rf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 £ixd4 £if6 5 £>c3 a6 6 Ae2 Karpov’s favourite move. ‘This quiet con¬ tinuation seems to me to be one of the most solid replies to the Najdorf Variation. It nor¬ mally requires Black to take independent posi¬ tional dedsions at the board, whereas in sharp variations the two sides act for a long time in accordance with the prescriptions of others, and even for a skilled player it can be difficult to work things out, when home analysis comes to an end.’ 6...e5 In my matches with Karpov (1984/85 and 1985) and Anand (1995) the only topic of dis¬ cussion was the flexible Scheveningen Varia¬ tion, arising after 6...e6 (see Volume 7). 7 £ib3 Ae7 8 0-0 ±e6 First 8...0-0 is slightly more accurate, and if 9 Jte3, only now 9.. Jte6!, but not 9...Wc7?! (Geller-Fischer, Curasao Candidates 1962, 2nd round). The notes to this game also describe the subtleties of the entire variation (cf.

(Ye Jiang- chuan, Batumi rapidplay 2001). 10.. .£>bd7 11 <ih1!? Geller’s new move. As in the 2nd game, White avoids the traditional 11 f5 Jtc4 and what was once the main continuation, but now is no longer topical: 12 jfc,e3 0-0 13 a5 b5! 14 axb6 ^xb6 (Volume 4} Game No. 70), as well as the unsuccessful attempt 12 a5 0-0 13 Jtg5 Bfc8 14 Jtxc4 Wxc4 with equality (Karpov- Gheorghiu, Moscow 1971). 11.. .0-0 Of course, not ll...fic8?! 12 6 ±c4 13 a5 0-0 14 ±xc4 Wxc4 15 fia4! Wc6 16 ±e3 with a bind (Geller-Ivkov, Hilversum 1973), since after 16...b5? 17 axb6 the a6-pawn is en prise. 12±e3 At that time the bold thrust 12 g4l? had not occurred to anyone — apparently it was first played in the game Korsunsky-Kasparov (Baku 1976). In addition, it was not yet too late to play 12 f5 Jtc4 and now either 13 a5 with the idea of 13...b5 14 axb6 <Sixb6 15 Jlg5 — although then 15...d5!? is not bad, or, even earlier, 13.Jfc.b5I? 14 £lxb5 axb5 15 lg5 b4 16 jfc.d3 <£fc5 (Ivkov-Mecking, Petropolis Interzonal 1973), or 13 Jtg5 flfc8 14 a5 h6, transposing into a position from the Oll-Kasparov game (for more details — cf. Volume 4, Game No. 70, note to White’s 12th move). 12...exf4 13 Hxf4 13...£ie5!? A novelty.

However, Polugayevsky, Botvinnik and other commentators overlooked the typical counter 17...d5!, which gives Black a good game: 18 ^ixd5 (18 ^h6+ gxh6 19 ®xf6 JLg7 or 19 Hxf6 dxe4 is worse for White) 18.. .^lxd5 19 exd5 Jlxf5 20 flxf5 e7 21 fff3 £ih4 22 Hh3 0X5 23 Wd3 g6, or 18 exd5 iLxf5 19 Sxf5 Ad6\ 20 ±g5 Ae5 21 Wc4 Wb6 etc. 14£>d4 14 a5! is more accurate (Game Nos.56 and 57), but not 14 £ld5 Jtxd5 15 exd5 £ifd7 16 Sb4 fife8 17 a5 Jtf6 with equality (Hulak- Portisch, Indonesia 1983). 14.. .5.d8! An idea which involves an original ar¬ rangement of the forces.

The first comparatively long think (10 min¬ utes) produces not the best reaction to the novelty — Karpov himself has spoken many times about the need to choose carefully a post for the queen, but here he voluntarily places it in a comer. little is also promised by 15 £if5 JLxf5 16 lxf5 ®c8! 17 Wfl We6 18 Hdl Sc8 19 ±d4 Jld8! (Adorjan-Portisch, Hungarian Champi¬ onship 1975). The most advisable move was the one recommended by many commenta¬ tors: 15 a5 (with the same threat of 4ixe6 and Jtb6), although after 15...fid7 16 £lf5 ±d8 17 0\d5 5^xd5 18 exd5 Jtxf5 19 fixf5 (Botvin¬ nik) 19...fie8 there is no question of any ad¬ vantage for White. 15.. .2d7 16 2d1 2e8 17 ®f5?!

This is the set-up devised by Polugayevsky: he has everything defended, and there is noth¬ ing for White to attack! 18 £>d4 After 25 minutes’ thought Karpov admits that his previous move was pointless.

Karpov promptly exploits his opponent’s indecision, opening a path for his queen. 233 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Polugayevsky suggested the prophylactic 20 h3!?

According to eye-witnesses, many of the experts in the press centre were puzzled as to why, after his insipidly played opening, Kar¬ pov avoided opportunities to force a draw, and only Balashov, who knew him well, calmly remarked: What does he want with a draw? For a long time now he’s been playing for a win.’ Obviously, in the given instance the grandmaster was evaluating not the position (it is now clearly more promising for Black), but the psychological mood of the two oppo¬ nents. 26.. .£>xe3 27 Sbl 4*8 This obvious move was made quickly. The sharper 27...g5!P also came into consideration (Polugayevsky). 28 <4>g1 Sc7 29 4f2 Polugayevsky’s recommendation 29 fle2 £c4 30 £ldl is inadequate on account of 30.. .d5 (Botvinnik) 31 exd5 Sxe2 32 Jtxe2 <§3xd5 or, even more unpleasant, 30...g5! 31 £>£2 h5. 29.. .£ic4 30 fid3 g5!

That is, 33.. .^xc2 34 Sxd6 4e7 35 2dl etc. 31 h3 h5 32 £}d5 Here Polugayevsky was already in time- trouble and such was his emotional state that he contrived, without leaving a single piece or 234 Anatoly the Twelfth pawn en prise, to lose this excellent position within eight moves! 32.. .£ixd5 The start of the turning point Black dreams of creating a fortress, not even think¬ ing about winning. 32..JSc5! was stronger (32..

Bxf6 34 4>g3 (34 <4>e2? £}e5) 34...h4+ 35 *f2 £>b6! winning a pawn (Polugayevsky), or 33 b4 Sc8 34 <&gl! (34 flc3? g4 and wins) 34...£>e5 35 Ic3 Ixc3 36 £>xc3 Ie8! 37 Jte2 Sc8 38 Hb3 ^c6!? (apparendy, not the only way) 39 jtd3 £id4 40 Ha3 4^d7, and White faces an un¬ pleasant defence. 33 2xd5! £ie5? The first step towards the abyss. After 33.. .flf6! Black would still have retained the advantage: 34 Hxg5 (34 sfegl £ie5) 34...4id2 35 Hel Sxc2 36 <4>g3 h4+! 37 <4>g4 Sxb2, or 34 Hf5 Sxf5 35 exf5 ^d2 36 Hdl (36 Scl 4ixB 37 ^xB Hc4!) 36...£ixB 37 ^x£3 fixc2 38 Hxd6 Bxb2, and White has to try and gain a draw in a rook endgame where he is a pawn down (39 f6 <4>e8 40 Bd5 Sb6 41 flxg5 Ixf6+ 42 ^e4 Hg6 43 Sxh5 Bxg2 etc.). 34 c3 h4 Another tiny concession. 34..JSf6 (Po¬ lugayevsky) 35 ie3 g4 36 Jie2 Sbt7 was bet¬ ter, with equality. 35 Ibdl *e7 36 2ld4! White strengthens the placing of his pieces as much as possible, but as yet it is still early to talk about any advantage for him. 36.. .f6?! Shutting in his own rook at e6, which, of course, should have been left with scope to move. In Botvinnik’s opinion, after 36...b6 37 lb4 2c6 38 ±c2 a5! 39 Bb3 <4>d8 Black would have had no difficulties. 36...Bf6 was also not bad (but not Polugayevsky’s recom¬ mendation 36..JSg6 on account of 37 jte2!), but the best was 36..JJc5! - here it is only White who could have had any problems: 37 Jte2 fixd5 38 Sxd5 ^d7! 39 Sxg5 <£k5, and after 40 Bg4 ^xe4+ 41 ^PB <Sid2+ 42 £ie4+ the result is a draw. 37 a5! (an important link in Karpov’s still far from obvious plan) 37...Bc6 37...£ic4?! was a blank shot in view of 38 Jte2! (38...£>xb2? 39 Ib4). 38 &e21 ‘White ignores the possibility of 38 flb4, forcing the retreat 38...Bc7, and prepares the advance of his queenside pawns.’ (Botvinnik) 38...*d8 Another impetuous time-trouble move. To his misfortune, Polugayevsky takes his king to c7 for the defence of the d6- and b7-pawns: but in freeing his rook at e6, he shuts in his other rook! With 38...£ig6 39 Bb4 Hc7 fol¬ lowed by ...Be5 Black could have hindered the opponent’s plan and consolidated his position.’ (Botvinnik). 38...b5!? 39 axb6 Bxb6 40 b4 Hc6 was also acceptable, for example: 41 c4 Bc7! 42 b5 a5, or 41 Ba5 lxc3 42 Bxa6 lc2 43 Ia7+ *4^8 44 b5 thd7 45 4?e3 f5 with equality. 39 c4 <4>c7? A fatal error with the flag about to fall. ‘Exhausted by the endless calculation of varia¬ tions (although it is well known that this does not improve confidence) and dispirited by my imperturbability, in time-trouble Polugayevsky not only squandered the enormous advantage he had gained, but also compromised his posi¬ tion.’ (Karpov) By 39...b6! (Polugayevsky) 40 b4 bxa5 41 235 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 2xa5 4>c7 Black would have safely emerged from time-trouble, retaining every chance of a draw. And even the ‘unprincipled’ 39..:4^7 40 b4 2c7 41 b5 Sc8! would still have enabled him to stay afloat 40 b4! fog6 An instantaneous reply — the last move be¬ fore the time control! Alas, 40...b6 was clearly too late on account of 41 b5 axb5 42 cxb5 Sc2 43 a6 and Hd2! But now too White cre¬ ates a passed pawn and wins the game. 41 b5 ‘The adjournment analysis of this position cannot have brought Black any comfort.’ (Botvinnik) The following day, in the words of Roshal, Karpov arrived for the resumption ‘tired and underslept, not having managed either to sleep or to have a bite to eat during the night-time analysis...’ It goes without saying — this is a familiar picture! 41...axb5 (41...Sc5? 42 b6+ <4>c6 43 Adi or 43 AhS was completely bad) 42 cxb5 Sc2 43 b6+ &67 If 43..:i?c6, then 44 (Polugayevsky), for example: 44...fixe4+ 45 Sxe4 sfexdS 46 a6!, or 44...Ic5 45 Sxc5+ dxc5 46 2d8 £>f4 47 Sc8+ <4>d7 48 S,c7+ (4>d6 49 Ag4, and the curtain comes down. 44 2d2! A move of fearful strength. Now the main soloist becomes the previously unnoticed ‘stu¬ pid’ bishop, which Karpov preserved from exchange! However, the variation 44 <4)e3 4}f4 45 Ab5+! ^e7 46 a6 £ixg2+ 47 4>£3 4^el+, which Polugayevsky considered to be drawn, would also have brought White success after 48 4^4!

Polugayevsky) 47 2b2 £>f4 (47...Ha5 48 Ac4 and Ad5+) 48 a7 Ha5 49 Jtc4!, and in view of the inevitable Sa2 Black resigned (TO). ‘This was not yet the end, just the first crack Polugayevsky was destroyed only by the following game,’ Karpov remembers. ‘Playing his own variations against him is like crossing a minefield. But that was how I handled this match: when you lose on your home ground, the pain is stronger. True, the risk was enor¬ mous, but I was not afraid to take a risk.’ In the 5th game Polugayevsky employed another novelty and quickly gained a winning position. But Karpov held on with defiant confidence, by which his opponent was liter¬ ally bewitched: ‘Polugayevsky7 believed in my composure... It should be said that in matches in general — somewhere around the 3rd or 4th game — you begin as though to perceive your opponent, his mood and, even perhaps his desires. Sometimes you guess his thoughts, or at least the direction in which these thoughts are working. It is probable that Polugayevsky too sensed that I was no longer at all afraid, that inwardly I had already given myself a nought and so I was absolutely calm. But he, he still had to achieve the win, and — wouldn’t you agree, it’s amusing in such a situation? — the psychological advantage as though passed to me. And this destroyed him!’ 236 Anatoly the Twelfth Game 55 L. Polugayevsky-A.

Black wants to retain his bishop or exchange it in under favourable cir¬ cumstances. 10±a2 By that time 10 Wd3, the main move of the 1960s, had already gone out of fashion. The 1st game went 10 Jl,d3 cxd4 11 exd4 JLb6 12 Ae3 and here White employed some home preparation which was highly rated by Botvinnik: 13 Jtg5!? (instead of 13 ^xd5 exd5 14 h3 £>e7 15 Ag5 f6 16 ±d2 AS with equality, Gligoric-Karpov, Hastings 1971/72) 13.. .fC 14 ±e3! £>ce7 15 Wc2 £)xe3 16 fke3 g6 17 «£c4 (17 £>a4i?) 17...£h5 18 flfel <4>g7 19 fladl with an advantage. But then Po¬ lugayevsky found some improvement for Black and he began playing 10 Jta2. 10.. .a6?! Karpov repeats a recent game of his with Taimanov, following the principle leave well alone’. But the point of this move is unclear: 4^b5 is not a threat, and the loss of time on the preparation of ...b7-b5 looks too great a luxury. The 7th game went 10...Jtb6 11 dxc5 Axc5 12 b4 Ad6 13 Ab2 We7 14 Wc2 Adi 15 Hfdl?! 4}e5! 16 4}g5 flac8 17 f4 23g6 with equality, but by 15 <2^4! (Polugayevsky) White could have retained the advantage. Other known equalising attempts are 10...cxd4 11 exd4 Ab6 12 Jte3 23d5 (Taimanov-Parma, Tbilisi 1973), or 10...1fe7 11 #c2 cxd4 12 exd4 fld8 (Donner-Unzicker, Bad Eibling 1974). 11 AbM A novelty!

Here is Polugayevsky’s commentary, dated 1981: When in the third game Black easily ob¬ tained an equal game, I thought to myself: is it worth going in for the same variation yet again? Is it worth ‘losing’ the white pieces for the sake of a theoretical argument? But nevertheless, I sensed that the truth was somewhere close at hand! And suddenly, quantity was transformed into quality — the many hours of analysis en¬ abled me to hit upon the correct order of 237 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors moves and to inflict a serious blow on the sys¬ tem which Karpov chose in the match, and which had been constantly played by... me my¬ self. White can pride himself on the move in the game. Contrary, apparently, to the unshake- able laws of chess, he moves his bishop three times in the opening, and, while still undevel¬ oped, obtains a virtually won position/ 11.. JLb6 The fact that Karpov spent just seven min¬ utes on this move testifies to his particularly practical approach to the solving of unex¬ pected opening problems. After ll...b5P! the simple 12 dxc5 is unpleasant, but ll...®e7 came into consideration. Sixteen years later Karpov explained the psychological motives behind his 11th and 12th moves: 1 again ran into a home preparation, and such a splendid one that, when my oppo¬ nent made this move, I instantly understood: this is the end, I am unable to save the game. Without even having time to become anxious or suffer, I immediately felt that things were hopeless. But if this is so, is it worth being up¬ set? After all, it has already happened and you can’t change anything; as they say, it’s no use crying over spilt milk And I adopted a phi¬ losophical stance. Of course, it didn’t occur to me to give in. I am a competitor, and as long as I have at least one chance, I will fight Let’s see, I thought, how he’s going to do it/ It is amazing that even many years later both contestants in the match considered White’s position after 11 Jtbl to be virtually won. Although even without the help of a computer, relying only on common sense and simple analysis, it can be established that Black’s defensive resources are still very great. 12®c2 ‘Straightforward and very strong!’ (Po- lugayevsky). 12 dxc5 itxc5 13 b4 and Jtb2 is also not bad (as in the 7th game — cf. the note to Black’s 10th move) with a slight, but very enduring advantage for White, typical of such symmetric structures. 12.. .g6? A fatal weakening of the long diagonal. Tliis does not solve Black’s defensive prob¬ lems, but what is he to do?’ writes Po- lugayevsky, giving 12...cxd4 13 exd4 ^hxd4 (? - G.K) 14 ^xd4 #xd4 15 ±e3 Wd6 16 ±g5 Bd8 (Botvinnik) 17 Jtxf6! with a powerful attack (if 17...gxf6 the intermediate move 18 JSdl! is strong). But the two players overestimated the vir¬ tues of White’s position — after 13...h6! Black could have successfully defended, for exam¬ ple: 14 Hdl (14 ±e3 4&e7 or even 14...£lxd4!?) 14...#07 (14...£le7!?) 15 £le4 (15 d5 £le5!) 15...£ke4 16 lrxe4 f5 17 Wc2 (17 Wh4 WfeT) 17..Jtd7 etc. 13 dxc5 ±xc5 14 b4 Ae7 (14..JLd6 15 fidl We7 16 Jk,b2 also favours White) 15 ±b2 15. ..e5 ‘Perhaps the best practical chance (15...b6? 16 %)e4). Black has no convenient squares for his light-squared bishop or queen.’ (Po- lugayevsky) 16 I£d1 We8 After 16...Wc7 Botvinnik and Polugayevsky recommended 17 Jla2 JLg4 18 ^hd5 £ixd5 19 jtxd5 Sac8 20 We4 ‘with very strong pres¬ sure’ and ‘a decisive advantage for White’, probably having in mind 20...jtf5 21 ®c4 ®b6 22 Wb3. It is perhaps even better to play 20 h3! Jtxf3 (20...Af5? 21 e4) 21 ±x£3 with an obvious advantage. And in addition — 17 e41? and £kI5! 238 Anatoly the Twelfth 17 b5 The positional approach — 17 h3, Aa2 and so on — was also possible.

He opens the diagonal for the white bishop and gives the opponent’s pieces a strong point in the centre — all for the sake of weakening the enemy king’s pawn screen. As yet it is altogether un¬ clear how this weakening will be exploited, but now there is some pretext for the creation of counterplay! 23 £id4 £ixd4 24 Axd4 Ag4 25 f3 (this cannot be avoided) 25...exf3 26 gxf3 Ae6 In Polugayevsky’s opinion, ‘perhaps the bishop should have been retreated to h5, so as to keep the fi-pawn under attack,’ but this would have allowed 27 Axf6 Axf6 28 <2M7, winning. 27 lad (the immediate 27 Wb2! was even stronger - Botvinnik) 27...1d8 28 Wb2! £e8 Tal, who arrived in the auditorium at this moment, gives an interesting account: ‘The first thing that struck me (I had not yet seen the position) was this: with measured steps Karpov was calmly walking from one end of the stage to the other. His opponent was sit¬ ting with his head in his hands, and simply physically it was felt that he was in trouble. “Everything would appear to be clear,” I thought to myself, “things are difficult for Polugayevsky.” But the demonstration board showed just the opposite! White was a clear exchange to the good — about such positions it is customary to say that the rest is a matter of technique. Who knows, perhaps Karpov’s confidence, his habit of retaining his compo¬ sure in the most desperate situations, was transmitted to his opponent and made Po- lugayevsky excessively nervous.’ The spectators saw that Anatoly even had a slight smile on his face. To be honest, this wasn’t a pretence, it somehow happened of its own accord,’ he said years later. ‘And it was 239 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the natural serenity of my behaviour that overwhelmed Polugayevsky. He saw that on the board I was done for, but at the same time I was so calm and playing so easily! This meant that I was seeing something that he didn’t see... He was a sorry sight. Again and again he worked through the variations — and he couldn’t understand how I could save my¬ self. This wasn’t surprising! - after all, he was looking for something that wasn’t there...’ 29 ±e5 ±d6 For the moment it is not possible to bring the queen out from the comer: after 29...Wa7 White decides matters with both the ‘cold’ 30 a4 Wa5 31 #b5, and the hot’ 30 Wb5l? £>g7 31 Bxd8+ Axd8 32 ±d4 (and if 32...1rxa3, then 33 Hal). 30 Jtxd6 (the paralysing 30 #d4! was very strong, and again 30...Wa7 is bad, because of 31 &xd6 Bxd6 32 £k8) 30...Bxd6 31 #b4?! As Botvinnik rightly remarked, here there was more than one way to win. In particular everyone suggested 31 Wb5 (depriving the black queen of the important g5-square) 31...Wd8 32 Bxd6 d6 33 Bdl #c7 34 We5, or 31 Bxd6 Hfxd6 32 a4 — according to Botvinnik ‘the a-pawn must be kepti, but 32 ®d4! is even better, since 32...Wxa3 is bad in view of 33 Hal Wb3 34 Ba8 and wins. 31.„#d8! The black queen suddenly comes active and White effectively has to win the game anew. Taking account of his vexation at the mistake committed and the tiredness accumulated by the fifth hour of play, it was not at all easy to readjust for such a task. 32 2xd6 £ixd6 33 Sdl #g5+ 34 *f2 4&f5 35 Wf4 ®f6 36 £>a4 ‘In time-trouble White makes the first cor¬ rect move along the selected path, but he goes wrong later.’ (Polugayevsky). After 36 <SM7? th2+ 37 <4>gl Axd7 38 *lxd7 ffe2! Black would have easily gained a draw. The alternative was 36 £k4 Axc4 37 Wxc4, and if 37...®e5, then 38 fff4 fh2+ 39 4^1 ®xa3 40 e4, practically forcing 40...Wc3+ 41 Wd2 WxB 42 exf5 #hl+ 43 4e2 Wxh2+ 44 4d3 Wh3+ 45 4c4 WxB 46 Wd8+ 4g7 47 ®d4+, when White should win. Botvinnik, Tal and Polugayevsky gave 37...®b2+ 38 Wc2 Wxa3, regarding this position as drawn. But, in my view, White is gradually able to convert his exchange advantage: 39 ®d3 Wc5 40 4e2 followed by e3-e4, or 39...®b2+ 40 Bd2 ®e5 41 f4 etc. 36...i±>3! 37 Bd2? ‘Chances of success were still offered by 37 Bel, as suggested by Furman. In this way White defends his important e3-pawn, and he can hope to gradually convert his material ad¬ vantage.’ (Polugayevsky). 37 Bd3! was more methodical, and after 37...jk,xa4 (37..Jkx2 38 Bd2) 38 Wxa4 Wb2+ 39 4gl Wcl+ 40 Wdl or 39...h5 40 Wb3 White’s task would be greatly simplified. 240 Anatoly the Twelfth 37.. .g5! "With amazing coolness and skill, Karpov discovers every conceivable chance for coun¬ terplay. As for White, he had clearly lost his composure.’ (Polugayevsky) 38#b8+ ‘After 38 We4 &xa4 39 ®xa4 We5 Black’s queen becomes more active, and he wins a pawn.’ (Botvinnik) 38.. .<£>g7 39 £>b2 Immediately before the time control the situation has become much sharper. The ‘ac¬ tive’ 39 £\c5?! is weak on account of 39...®c3! 40 <£ixb3 #xe3+ 41 <4>fl #xf3+ 42 <£gl Wxb3 (42...1re3+!?) 43 We5+ <4>g6, and White has only a draw. 39.. .±d5! After 39...We7 40 fie2 Black’s initiative could have evaporated. 40 ®d3?! With his last move before the time control White throws away the last remnants of his former advantage. In his commentary Po¬ lugayevsky recommends 40 with the idea of 40...4ih4 (Botvinnik) 41 f4!, when Black loses (41..JLc6 42 Wd8), and gives 40...£\xe3! as the only move leading to a draw, which Karpov would have had to find at the board! At the same time he adds: ‘40 f4 fails, of course, to 40...£M6!’ But this sharp continua¬ tion was also dangerous for Black and would have forced him to demonstrate precise ad¬ journment analysis! After 41 Hxd5 Wxb2+ 42 <4>g3 £ie4+ 43 <4>f3 £\d2+ 44 <A>g4! the only way to play is 44...h5+! 45 ^xhS ^e4!, for example: 46 fxgS #e2+ 47 i>h4 #f2+ 48 ^g4 %2+ 49 *£5 #xg5+! 50 <ixe4 %2+ with perpetual pursuit of the king, or 46 Sxg5+ £lxg5 47 fxg5 (47 4>xg5 #g2+ 48 Wg6+ etc.) 47...tre2+ 48 <*h4 Wxc3 49 Wg3 Ve4+ 50 Wg4 #el+ 51 <4>h5 We8 52 Wd4+ f6+ 53 <4>g4 We2+, saving the queen endgame a pawn down. 40...®d6! 41 £>f4! This sealed move is the only way to force a draw. The resumption did not last long. 41...gxf4 42 Sxd5 ®b2+ (42...fxe3+ 43 <A)xe3 ®e6+ 44 4?d4 is no better) 43 <441! fxe3 44 Hg5+! 'A-'A In view of 44...^h6 45 Wxd6+ 4?xg5 46 We7+, picking up the e3-pawn. ‘A draw which was equivalent to a catastro¬ phe: Polugayevsky realised that he couldn’t win any position against me,’ Karpov sums up. It was effectively this game that was the last in the match,’ Tal echoes, TThe rest of the games were one-sided. Karpov was very much on the rise, whereas Polugayevsky was unable to regain his composure after the shocks in the 4th and 5th games.’ He consistently failed to convert his superiority in opening prepara¬ tion, since he was inferior to his opponent in the subsequent play... Polugayevsky arrived for the 6th game feel- 24 7 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ing downcast. He was tormented by thoughts about misfortune and the unjustness of fate: instead of a certain one and a half points — only half a point, instead of the lead in the match — the role of having to catch up. At this moment — after just five games! — for him, as for many other experts, it was still hard to ap¬ preciate fully what an enormous force he was up against.

An important improvement (in the 4th game 14 ^ld4 was played — Game No.54). White immediately fixes the enemy queenside and vacates the a4-square, via which his queen’s rook may come into play. 14.. .4Yfd7 (later they played only 14...Sac8 or 14.. .5fe8 — Game No.57) IBBfl &f6?! Underestimating the role of White’s poten¬ tial outpost at d5, which is in enemy territory and therefore demands special control. 15.. .5ac8 or 15...fife8 is sounder, not fearing the manoeuvre 4^d4-f5. 16 <£>d5! JlxdB 17 »xd5! A sudden sharpening of the struggle — an intuitive sacrifice of two pawns! In explaining this unusual decision in a commentary made in 1978, Karpov discloses the peculiarities of his style: "Sometimes I am reproached for being dry, rational and careful. Yes, I am a practical player, and my play is largely based on tech¬ nique. I attempt to play “correct” chess and never take risks as, say, Larsen does. As White, like everyone else, I aim for an advantage from the very start, but as Black I try first of all to equalise. But when there is a choice of moves, I by no means choose the simplest, but rather the most expedient. If there are several equally good continuations, my choice depends to a great extent on my opponents. Against Tal, for instance, I prefer to go in for simple positions, which are not to his taste, whereas against Petrosian I try to make the play more complicated. But if I see only one correct path, then, whoever is playing against me, I go only along that path. However, I feel that in recent times my style has undergone certain changes. "Let us return to the game. Previously the sacrifice of two pawns, which I offered to Po- lugayevsky, would probably not have occurred to me. Everyone thought that it had been pre¬ pared at home. But, "‘as God is my witness”, it was pure improvisation at the board. Even today I find this a “terrible” decision on my 242 Anatoly the Twelfth part. But after the quiet 17 exd5 ^c4 18 Axc4 Wxc4 nothing remains of White’s opening advantage/ 17...Wxc2! Accepting the challenge! Polugayevsky thought for more than an hour here: suppose White had a forced win prepared at home?! In Karpov’s opinion, ‘in the event of Black de¬ clining the sacrifice, he would have come un¬ der heavy positional pressure.’ In my opinion, after 17...^c6 18 c3 Jte5 he would merely have had a slightly inferior position, but - and this is far more important — Polugayevsky probably did not believe that he would be able to defend it against Karpov! 18 £)d4 #xb2 (18...Wc5?! 19 £>6! is dan¬ gerous) 19 lab 1 Wc3 20 £>f5 #c2! The best defence. After 20...£c5 21 JLd4 Wc2 22 £>xd6 Wxe2 23 ±xe5 £d7 (23..Jtxe5? 24 £>xf7!) 24 ±g3 White’s domi- nation would have extended over almost the entire board. 21 Sbel?! This move took Karpov 20 minutes, but... An inaccuracy: now Black finds a defence. After 21 Bfel White would have gained a big advantage.’ Yes, the deployment of the rooks is one of the most treacherous open¬ ing/ middlegame problems! But in the given instance it made sense to leave the rook on the b-file, retaining the threat of its invasion at b7. However, whether White has an advantage after 21 Sfel is still an open question: 1) 21...fifd8 22 £>xd6 ^ib8!?

An obvious move, but., now Black is bal¬ ancing on the edge of a precipice! It is strange that Karpov does not make any comment on it: after all, back in 1975 Botvinnik pointed out that ‘Black could have immediately mobilised his queen’s rook by 21...Bad8!, and in the event of 22 ^xd6 (22 Wxb7?l ^hc5! — G.K) 22.. .^b8 consolidated the placing of his pieces.’ After 23 WcS ®a4! this would indeed have given him a clear way to equalise: 1) 24 Sal Wb3 25 Sfbl (25 Sabi lfa2) 25.. .^bd7!

Karpov hurries to regain the material as soon as possible, although 25 ®h5!

Polugayevsky cracks under the tension and commits a decisive mistake. '26...®e2 would have given Black some counterplay, although even here after 27 Jtb6 the advantage is with White.’ (Karpov). A questionable assertion: 27.. .£id3! 28 £if4 29 £ie3 ±e5, and no advantage is apparent. 27 Sdel!? is far more unpleasant for Black. After this Botvinnik recommended 27...Wh5 (? — G.K) 28 Sf5 Wg4 'with a tenable posi¬ tion’, but here 29 e5! is strong. And 28 fixfti! gxf6 29 4}f5 is even better, with an irresistible attack: 29...Ib5 30 ±h6!, or 29...Sfe8 30 ffc7l etc. Where then should the queen move to?

(30...^c6 31 Wd7 etc.). It would appear that only 27...Hrb2! (de¬ fending against Hxf6!) would have retained equal chances, for example: 28 ^3c4 (nothing is achieved by 28 flbl ®e2 or 28 Hf2 Wc5 29 Jlf4 Wd4) 28...®a2 29 e5 £k2!, and Black is alright. 27 ±W. A typical Karpov move, denying the oppo¬ nent even a hint of counterplay: 'The threat of e4-e5 restricts Black, and his knight at b4 finds itself out of play.’ The sharp 27 flxf6! gxf6 28 jLh6 with the threat of would also have been decisive, for example: 28...1§c2 (28...<S3d3 29 Axf8) 29 flcl ®d3? 30 Wd7!

The threat is stronger than its execution! Paradoxically, this often is indeed the case.

Material is equal, but White’s pieces occupy strong posi¬ tions and control the most important squares on the board, whereas the black pieces are merely convenient targets for him to attack. All that remains is for White to concentrate his forces for the decisive stroke against Black’s kingside.’ (Botvinnik) 30 fif3 #c2 31 Idf 1 ±d4 32 ±h6 (a sim¬ ple, but spectacular finish; 32 Wxe4 33 itd6 would also have won) 32...£}c6 33 £rf5 33 ^xf7 ®c4 would by no means have ‘complicated matters’, as Karpov writes, but was a second way to win: after 34 Jtxg7! to avoid a pretty mate Black would have had to part first with his queen — 34...Wxfl+ 35 ttxfl Jtxg7 36 1ttb3!, then with a rook — 36...flxf7 (36...£kl4 37 ^h6++ #h8 38 %8+! and £if7 mate) 37 1§xf7+ ibS, and after 38 Wc7! — also with his knight! 33...Wb2 Or 33...Jte5 34 Jtxg7!

He could perhaps have gained this in the 7th game. Po- lugayevsky played very nervously: first he lost the opening advantage he had gained, then he suddenly launched an unfounded attack on the kingside, which merely led to the creation of weaknesses in his own position. On the 25th move Karpov could have advantageously opened the centre and gained a marked advan¬ tage. But, as Tal put it, £it would appear that he decided not to deviate from his planned pro¬ gram, in which the optimal result in the “black” games was a draw.’ The match concluded in the 8th game. In essence, this was the finishing off of a seri¬ ously wounded opponent.

A good move, made however after 45 min¬ utes’ thought, which indicates Polugayevsky’s uncertainty. The awkward 16...^\c6 (Botvin- nik, Karpov) is of no use to Black. 17 ld4 A manoeuvre which at the time was con¬ sidered dangerous for Black. But is this in fact so? 17...»c6 Annotating this game in Informator,; Po- lugayevsky suggested here 17...Sxc3! 18 bxc3 Wc6! 'with an unclear game’. Karpov retorts: 'However, in White’s favour is the very fact that Black has to go in for a questionable ex¬ change sacrifice, aiming in return for unclear positional compensation.’ Using pure logic in the evaluation of a posi¬ tion is, of course, pointless. But if account is taken of concrete factors, it becomes apparent Black does indeed have very clear compensa¬ tion for the exchange: his bastions in the cen¬ tre are strong, whereas White’s pawns are broken and are targets for attack. 19...Wxc3 is threatened, and he has to play 19 Wei (19 c4 £tfd7!), but after 19...d5! 20 Bdl (20 Wg3 <S3g6) 20...<S3xe4 Black has nothing to fear, for example: 21 c4 <S3xc4 22 <S3d4 Wc8 23 £ixe6 fxe6 24 Jtd3 <S}xb6 25 Jtxe4 dxe4 26 axb6 e3 with equality. 18 Bd2 Karpov is content with his position: 'So, White has regrouped and wants to carry out the manoeuvre ^b3-d4-f5 which is traditional in this variation. Whereas the opponent has no active plan’ (usually associated with ...^fd7). But as yet he does not have any problems! 18.. .±xb3 'Hurrying to eliminate this promising knight. If 18...^g6 there would have followed 19 <Sid4.’ (Karpov). Polugayevsky also evalu¬ ated this variation White’s favour. However, it is hard to say how dangerous his initiative is in reality: 19...Wd7 20 fifl ^e5, and after 21 <S}f5, apart from 21.. Jtxf5, the typical sacrifice 21.. .5xc3!? 22 bxc3 ^xe4 comes into consid¬ eration. 246 Anatoly the Twelfth It can now be concluded that White’s entire plan with the manoeuvre of his rook (al-a4- d4-d2) and knight (b3-d4-f5) is not so terrible, as was once written by the commentators and authors of theoretical articles. Moreover, the exchange 18...jtxb3, although not obligatory, does not yet spoil anything. 19 cxb3 £>fd7 (of course, not 19...£>g6 20 Sfl ^xe4? in view of 21 ^xe4 Wxc4 22 Jtf3 #b4 23 ±xb7) 20 &g1 20.. .±gb?

Ag5) 21.. .®xa5 22 £}xe7+ Bxe7 23 Sxd6 ®c7, and the powerful outpost at e5 secured Black a good position. Karpov again retorts: 'However, in all probability White’s play can be improved: 21 ld5 <&£6 22 ±b6 Wc6 23 fixf6! gxf6 24 ±g4 with a powerful initiative for the exchange.’ Alas, this variation has a 'hole’: instead of 22.. .Wc6? Black has the very strong 22...^xd5! 23 Axc7 ^xf4 24 ±b6 ^xe2 25 #xe2 Af6 with excellent compensation for the queen. After giving up his queen in another way, Polugayevsky encounters insuperable difficul¬ ties. 21 5xd6 ±xf4 In the event of 21...tfxd6 (21...®c7 22 Sf5) 22 Wxd6 Axf4 23 Wb4 Sb8 24 ^d5 the white queen is again far more agile than the black rooks, and the pawn march b3-b4-b5 is on the agenda. 22 2xc6 Sxc6 23 b4!

But here too after 24 b5 Black cannot save the game: 24...axb5 25 g3! jtg5(h6) 26 JtxbS with the threat of Wd5. 'Black should have united his rooks by 23.. .Hee6, keeping the important d6-square under control.’ (Botvinnik). And indeed, 24 b5 axb5 (24...1ed6? 25 Wfll; 24...Hc7 25 ±b6!; 24.. .Hc8 25 ttd5!) 25 ±xb5 flcd6 26 £>d5 Jtg5 looks rather more tenacious. 24 b5 2ce6 25 bxa6 bxa6 26 g3 ±g5 27 h4 ±h6 28 ±b6! ‘The pawn weakness at a6 has fatal conse¬ quences.’ (Karpov).

Here one in¬ voluntarily remembers Fischer’s statement after his match with Taimanov: The 6-0 result was too high... The struggle was much more diffi¬ cult... It is easier to be a gentleman when you win...’ But one can certainly agree with Tal: Tn the competitive, psychological sense, Karpov was head and shoulders above his opponent’ This fact was confirmed by Polugayevsky himself: TSlow, with the benefit of hindsight, I see very dearly the errors I made in preparing for the match. I devoted too much time to purely chess work, and did not concentrate suffidendy on the need for correct psycho¬ logical preparation.’ However, there was also ‘something else’, which was described well by grandmaster Alexei Suetin: ‘I don’t want to say that the outcome of the match was not influenced in any way by either Polugayevsky’s psychologi¬ cal condition, or his opening repertoire. Of course they influenced it. But the main reason for such a heavy defeat was the play of the winner. Karpov has an astounding technique, which is at the service of a healthy practicality. He plays easily and quickly, he accuratdy evaluates a position, and one gains the impres¬ sion that Karpov’s analytical scales are far more sensitive than those of his opponents. It has been remarked many times that Karpov has little experience. This is so. But notice how quickly the grandmaster gains this experi¬ ence. When he is playing, Karpov the student is all the time learning. And the teachers, when they capitulate, give him high marks.’ Many of those who witnessed this short match were left with the feeling that they had witnessed a minor mirade (what would they think after the semi-final!). ‘But the most stag¬ gering thing is that Polugayevsky’s failure in no way affected his attitude towards me,’ Karpov recalls. ‘On the contrary: the worse things went for him, the more courteous and benevolent he became to me. With no one dse did I ever dis¬ cuss in such detail and so openly a game just played. These analyses drew us very dose. One of the paradoxical results of the match was that I gained Polugayevsky’s friendship. If only all matches would end in this way!’ Leap into the Unknown Karpov’s next encounter — his semi-final match with Spassky (Leningrad, spring 1974) deserves to be covered in the greatest detail: this was one of the most dramatic chess events of those years, fully comparable with a match for the world crown. The young, rap¬ idly improving chess talent was opposed by the 37-year-old ex-world champion, who had just brilliantly won the USSR Championship and his quarter-final match with Byrne. They played up to four wins, but with a limit of 20 games. The other semi-final brought together Pet¬ rosian and Korchnoi, and so at the time Kar¬ pov was compared with the young D’Artagnan, who had joined up with the three 248 Anatoly the Twelfth musketeers. Roshal: *But before the semi-final match Spassky was nevertheless considered the favourite. It appeared to many that in the quarter-final it was not that Karpov had beaten Polugayevsky, but rather that the latter had somehow beaten himself. Only Botvinnik smiled: “Just as ‘inexplicably’ he will also beat Spassky.” And the cautious Petrosian pre¬ dicted a struggle “no less interesting than a clash between any one of the Candidates and Fischer”. But the majority of the forecasts anticipated a win for Spassky.’ The FIDE President Max Euwe, who ar¬ rived for the opening of the match, was no exception. At a press conference he confirmed that he gave some preference to Spassky. ‘Now he has once again captured his earlier form’ (regarding which Botvinnik remarked that it wasn’t at all becoming for the FIDE President to "play at forecasting’). True, Euwe promptly added: ‘However, in the develop¬ ment of talented young players, qualitative leaps can take place. It is hard to guess whether Karpov will now make such a leap. If he does, then I would not rule out the possi¬ bility of him even winning the title of world champion.’ But what did Karpov himself think about the forthcoming match? T did not even try to guess how it would turn out Whereas I could compare myself with Polugayevsky, Spassky was a weight that I had never before lifted,’ he was to say years later. ‘Neither before nor after this match have I worked so much on chess. The general conception was developed, the psychological strategy was developed; weak points in my opponent’s armour and fencing skill were sought — and methods were devel¬ oped, in order to try and beat him here, or land a strong blow there. I endeavoured to forget about my deep respect for Spassky, I endeav¬ oured not to think about his grandiosity. I told myself: before you is a very difficult, but un¬ usual task... A great help was provided by the material from Spassky’s match with Fischer. Both chess, and psychological material.’ Indeed, the Spassky-Fischer match (1972) had emphasised the need for a serious study of the opening. But Fischer had retired from chess, and the echoes of Reykjavik gradually quietened down. The sharp opening duels of that match began to be forgotten, and prepa¬ ration again reduced to a study of theoretical reviews in the magazines Sbakbmaty v SSSR. and Shakhmatny bulletin and an examination of games in Informator. As before, the opening lines used by Spassky against equally ‘erudite’ opponents enabled him to obtain complicated middlegame positions, in which the main role was played by improvisation and intuition. But this was a short period of calm before a radical revision of the methods of opening study. The Spassky-Karpov match was that epochal event, after which the enormous sig¬ nificance of opening proficiency became clear to everyone. Spassky prepared for the match in the old-fashioned way, and this method proved inadequate, quickly leaving him effec¬ tively ‘without an opening’. Whereas, by con¬ trast, for two and a half months Karpov and his trainers polished their planned opening systems, studying not so much variations, as the conceptual fundamentals of opening lines, their middlegame and sometimes their end¬ game positions. Karpov worked for 10-12 hours a day! Spassky had no conception of the strength of the grandmaster against whom he had been drawn... On this occasion Karpov was helped by Furman and Razuvaev (there was no Balashov: Spassky had turned to him for help, not knowing that he was in the opponent’s team, and Yuri decided to observe neutrality). Two major surprises were prepared: with Black — the Caro-Kann Defence, and with White - a partial switch to 1 d4, i.e. ‘serving’ from either side. The result? Throughout the match Spassky was unable to adapt properly to me; my opening play was very uncomfort¬ able for him. He, like Polugayevsky before him, was unable to obtain his favourite posi¬ tions.’ (Karpov) 249 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors The start of the match appeared to confirm the forecasts. Because of a bad cold, Anatoly was forced to take a time-out even before the first game. ‘A day later they sat down at the board: a self-confident, sun-tanned (from a mountain resort), athletic-looking man, and a pale, thin youth, not yet recovered from his cold and hence slightly hunched,’ describes Roshal, but when before his eyes Karpov lost with White in a Sicilian Defence (Volume 3, Game No.83), he noticed a curious detail: ‘Leaving for home after the hopeless ad¬ journment session, Furman was upset but he did not forget to remind Karpov that Fischer also lost the first game to Spassky, and this did not prevent him from winning the match.’ And this was the path followed by Karpov, who keenly sensed his opponent’s state of mind. ‘The win in the first game did Spassky a bad service, just like his win in the first game against Fischer. He decided that everything was dear, and he calmed down and relaxed.’ In the 2nd game, in reply to 1 e4, Anatoly employed the Caro-Kann Defence for the first time in his life! And his complacendy inclined opponent dedded to defer the opening de¬ bate, by offering a draw as early as the 17th move. Botvinnik: ‘Both Spassky and the “ex¬ perts” had no doubts about the outcome. This decision was symptomatic: the present-day Spassky wants to win with the minimum of effort; he is not keyed up for intense exertion, and he does not press himself.’ For the further course of the match the 3rd game was very important. Game 58 A. Karpov-B. Spassky Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 3rd game _King’s Indian Defence E91_ 1 d4!? Everyone was expecting 1 e4 and an im¬ provement for White in the Sicilian Defence, but Spassky was given a new surprise: Karpov had begun a game in this way only a few times in his life! Realising that his young opponent was prepared for the main lines of his opening repertoire, the ex-world champion had to choose at the board between those that he had already employed, and something that was new, but familiar only in general terms. I can imagine what Spassky was thinking about during those moments. He never aimed to be an openings expert, regarding himself as king of the middlegame. His long-standing trainer Igor Bondarevsky ‘did not overrate’ the role of opening knowledge, but thought that the main thing was to have a clear head before a game, and that about the opening it was suf¬ ficient to have a general impression and, ide¬ ally, a knowledge of a few subdeties. 1...£tf6 2c4 g6 A surprise in return? Not wishing to check what the Karpov team had prepared in the Nim2o-Indian Defence or the Queen’s Indian, Spassky began remembering his King’s Indian games, trying to find a half-forgotten set-up and some ideas which could be used. 3 3Lq7 4 e4 d6 5 ®f3 0-0 6 Ae2 c5 Spassky is afraid of preparations in the main lines, and instead of 6...e5 he replies with a rare variation of the King’s Indian. However, this was hardly a good decision. It allowed Karpov to treat the positions, arising in a new opening for him, using the general considerations by which he was guided in similar situations. 7 0-0±g4 250 Anatoly the Twelfth 8 d5 Karpov’s choice was not hard to guess. When studying Polugayevsk/s games, he, of course, noticed how splendidly the latter han¬ dled such positions as White, and he adopted his method. In addition, Karpov liked to block the centre with d4-d5 in the Ruy Lopez, and this experience came in useful in the King’s Indian. 8...£>bd7 9 Ag5 a6 10 a4 Wc7 11 #d2 The exchange of bishops suggested by Botvinnik - 11 £>d2 ±xc2 12 Wxe2 — prom¬ ises little after 12...h6 13 ±£4 Wa5. Karpov provokes a different exchange, reckoning that sooner or later his light-squared bishop will gain scope. 11.. .2.e8 12 h3 Axf3 13 Axf3 e6 14 b3?! The attempt to open up the game immedi¬ ately — 14 dxe6 fxe6 15 .Bad 1 would have been parried by 15...^e5! 16 Jte2 4lf7 with equal¬ ity. And Karpov decides to wait, for the mo¬ ment accumulating small pluses. But instead of 14 b3, which deprives his knight of sup¬ port, it was better to play 14 a5 (seizing space and, above all, restricting the black queen) 14.. .<4>h8 15 fia2 exd5 16 cxd5 c4 17 Ba4 £>e5 18l,e2. 14.. .^?h8! (the start of a standard regrouping) 15 JLe3 For the moment the bishop is doing noth¬ ing at g5, and White withdraws it to a position which soon proves unpleasant for the oppo¬ nent Botvinnik suggested 15 Bad, but it is not clear what White can boast of after 15.. .®b6 16 Wf4 £ig8. 15.. .£\g8 16 Ae2 The second bishop also begins looking in the direction of the queenside, just in case making way for the f2-pawn. 16.. .e5!? An unexpected, but quite logical decision: Black is counting on the effect of ...f7-f5 and the exchange of the dark-squared bishops. Another way of fighting for equality was the opening of the centre — 16...Hfa5 17 Bad exd5. The symmetric 18 exd5 would have al¬ lowed Black counter-chances after 18...f5 — 19 g3 He7 20 Hfel Bfe8, or 19 Ad3 Wb4 (19..T4? 20 £}e4!) 20 Af4 £te5. His problems are more difficult after 18 cxd5, although he has a choice: 1) 18...Jtxc3 19 2xc3 Bxe4 20 Wb2 ^gf6 21 JLf3 Be7. This direct attempt to hold the position involves an exchange sacrifice for some compensation: 22 jtg5 Be5 23 Ji£4 <4>g8 24 Axe5 foxe5 25 Bbl Wb4, or 22 Ag4 <&>g8 23 Jixd7 £>xd5 24 ±d2 lxd7 25 Bf3 Wd8 26 Ah6 f5 27 fldl £tf6 28 &xf8 Wx£8; 2) 18...^gf6 19 Hfel Wb4, launching into complications, which after a mass elimination of pieces may conclude in a prosaic endgame: 20 JLf4 (20 f3 ^hhS, and Black has a reason¬ able variation of the Modem Benorti) 20.. .^xe4 (20...^e5 21 ^c2! is a variation of 251 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the Modem Benoni which is now more pleas¬ ant for White) 21 £lxe4 JSxe4 22 Wxb4 cxb4 23 Axd6 Hfe8 24 f3!

Here the chances of a draw are very real, for example: 34 fib 5 fixd6 35 ffxb4 fid2, or 34 fla6 b3 35 Hb6 <i>f6 36 a5 *e6 37 a6 ffxd6 38 a7 Hxb6 39 a8W b2 40 Wa2 <4^6 41 Wbl h5 — with such a queen White cannot win. 17 g4 Strategically a very committing move. Kar¬ pov tries to restrict the opponent’s counter¬ play, reckoning that the weakening of his kingside is unimportant, since the black pieces are defensively placed. Indeed, the g2-g4 ad¬ vance is an important part of White’s plan, but for maximum effect the most appropriate moment for it needs to be chosen. Again, as on the 14th move, 17 a5 f5! 18 f3 was more advisable, and if 18...Wd8! (18...^gf6 19 g4!) the prophylactic 19 <i>h2! is strong, in order after 19...Wh4 to have 20 g3 (with the sequel 20...We7 21 g4! Wh4 22 Wei! Wxel 23 Baxel Ah6 24 Axh6 <§3xh6 25 ex£5 gx£5 26 Adi fle7 27 Ac2 fig7 28 figl), while if 19...^gf6 this is the right time to play for restriction — 20 g4!, not allowing the activation of the queen. Here 19...f4 is ineffective, since without his light-squared bishop Black cannot create any serious threats to the enemy king, whereas White’s offensive on the other flank will develop unchecked. 17.. .Wd8?! Spassky sticks to his plan, but the immedi¬ ate 17...f5! was stronger, and after 18 £3 (if 18 gxf5 gxf5 19 exf5, then Black has 19...e4! 20 £3 ex£3 21 Hxf3 — 21 Ax£3? Hxe3! — 21...Wa5 22 ficl with strong counterplay) 18...Wd8 19 si?g2 it could have led to a ‘dead draw’: 19.. .f4! 20 Af2 a5! 21 h4 h6 22 4^b5 £ib8. 18 4g2 Wh4 The penultimate link of the pfanned set-up: the h3-pawn is blocked, and if 19 Ag5 there follows 19..Jth6! With the king at g2, the at¬ tempt by 18...£5 to block the position com¬ pletely, which was successful a move earlier (hoping for 19 £3 f4! 20 A£2 a5!), on this occa¬ sion would have led to an advantage for White: 19 gxf5! gx5 20 exf5 e4! 21 fi! exf3+ 22 J,xf3 23 a5 £le5 24 ±g5 <Slf7 251,14. 19 f3 The turning point in the game, which for a long time remained undisclosed. 19.. .Ah6? One can only try and guess why Spassky faltered at the height of the battle. Perhaps he thought that, with the queens on, Black did not have to fear the further advance of the g4- pawn? 19...f6 20 lf2 lh6 21 Wd3 %5 22 h4! Wd2 23 fifdl Wxd3 24 lxd3 was hardly tol- erable, but the thematic 19...£5! would have maintained the tension: after 20 a5 Ah6! 21 ±xh6 (21 g5? £41; 21 exf5 gxf5 22 Ad3 e4!) 21.. .^1xh6 22 Wei Wd8! Black has active counterplay, while 20 Wei Wxel 21 2axel did not promise the same stunning effect as in the game, since the exchange of the dark- squared bishops would have followed — 21.. .Ah6! 22 Axh6 <5ixh6. It would appear that the passivity of the e2-bishop does not allow White any chances of success: 23 a5 fxg4 24 hxg4 (24 fxg4 g5 25 £kll flxfl 26 fixfl Sf8) 24...^£7! 25 Hbl fic8 26 b4cxb4 252 Anatoly the Twelfth 27 Hxb4 28 ttfbl Bc7 29 ^a4 £ka4 30 Sxa4 Se8 31 fiab4 Iee7 32 Sb6 ^g7, and dungs end in a draw. But 23 exf5! gxf5 24 a5 would have slightly opened die kingside and left Karpov with real chances of an advantage. 20 g5! ±g7 21 ±f2 !ff4 22 Ae3 Wh4 23 ®e1! Unexpected and very effective. After the exchange of queens, the threats to White’s king disappear, and he suddenly acquires a superiority in force on the queenside, to where Black, squeezed into two ranks, cannot quickly transfer his reserves. The threat of exchanging the dark-squared bishops can now be forgot¬ ten about, the wedge at g5 hinders the normal movements of the enemy pieces, and during the time that Black spends on the exchange of this harmful pawn. White will open the b-file with decisive effect. 23...#xe1 24 Sfxel h6 Or 24...f6 25 h4. Black is unable to close the queenside (24...a5? 25 ^b5), and he can only wait for the unavoidable breaching of his defences. 25 h4 hxg5 (White also has an overwhelm¬ ing position after 25...f6 26 Ehl) 26 hxg5 7 By just a single chess instant Black is too late with ...a6-a5. 27 a5! After this the game is effectively over. Spassky’s desperate resistance can no longer change anything. 27...f6 28 lebl fxg5 29 b4! (theg5-pawn will not run away) 29...£rf5!? Realising that, given the normal develop¬ ment of events, there is no chance of saving the game (29...g4 30 bxcSl £)xc5 31 JtxcS dxc5 32 Hxb7), Spassky sacrifices his knight, to sharply change the character of the play. 30 Axg5! Seeing that 30 exf5 e4! 31 Jtd2 exf3+ 32 Jlxf3 gxf5 sharpens the play and allows the opponent some chances, Karpov takes an¬ other psychologically subtle decision. He al¬ lows the black knight to establish itself in the centre of the board, where it proves to be in splendid isolation, not influencing the play in any way. As a result, the opponent still has no hope of counterplay. In deciding whether or not to take, Karpov spent just four minutes! It is interesting that for computer programs the continuations 30 exf5 and 30 Jtxg5 are roughly equivalent. But the capture of the piece should have won more quickly, as demonstrated by a continuation of the above variation: 33 ilh5 fic8 34 b5 g4 35 Bhl 4^8 36 ±g6 ±d4 37 ±h7+ 4g7 38 A,h5 f4 39 fig5+! and wins. 30...£id4 (if 30...Jh6, then 31 exf5! ±xg5 32 ^3e4 is extremely unpleasant) 31 bxc5 4^xc5 32 Bb6! The start of the decisive invasion. The d6- pawn is under fire, but again Karpov is not in a hurry to take it, first methodically strength¬ ening the placing of his pieces. 253 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 32.. .Af6 33 Shi +! The most accurate way. After 33 flxd6 Botvinnik saw 33...<45g7 as being a last chance of saving the game, although it could only be a question of prolonging the suffering: 34 fixf6 fixf6 35 ±xf6+ *xf6 36 Adi 37 Sbl He7 38 *hc2 g5 39 flb6+ <4>g7 40 £ixd4 exd4 41 Aa4! and wins. 33.. .*g7 34 Ah6+ 4>g8 35 Axf8 2xf8 36 Sxd6 si?g7 37 Adi! The hitherto slumbering bishop helps one of the knights to be exchanged. Its finest hour will arrive 10 moves later! 37.. .Ae7 (if 37...Ad8, then 38 <§3a4 Ac7 39 ^xc5 Axd6 40 ^3xb7 Jtb4 41 c5 is convinc¬ ing) 38 2b6 Ad8 39 Sbl Sf7 40 ^a4 ^d3 41 £hb6 g5 42 ^c8! An elegant solution. Now if 42...g4 there is the strong reply 43 4^d6 gxf3+ 44 4T1, and the fine-looking knight in the centre is unable to help Black. 42.. .^c5 43 4bd6 Sd7 44 £if5+ ^xf5 45 exf5 e4 The sealed move. Why Spassky came along to the resumption is the last mystery of this wonderful battle. 46 fxe4 £>xe4 47 Aa4 Se7 48 Sbel! £ic5 49 Sxe7+ Axe7 50 Ac2 Ad8 51 Sal *f6 52 d6! *d7 53 Sbl st?e5 54 Sdl ^f4 55 Sel 1-0 Black was punished for his indecisiveness in carrying out a basically good plan. The score became 1-1, and Karpov gained a new lease of life. In the 4th game Spassky again did not gain any advantage against the Caro-Kann Defence and satisfied himself with a slighdy inferior ending — draw on the 43rd move. Every match has its culminating games, when the opponents come face to face, dis¬ playing all their ability. Here the 5th game was one of these. On this occasion Spassky was not afraid to engage in a crucial battle in the main direction — in an opening set-up for which the opponent was undoubtedly very heavily prepared. Game 59 A.Karpov-B.Spassky Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 5th game Nim^o-Indian Defence E59 1 d4 (again!) 1...£tf6 2 c4 e6 3 £ic3 Ab4 4 4hf3 (4 a3 — Game No.4; 4 e3 — Game Nos.29 and 75) 4...c5 5 e3 d5 6 Ad3 0-0 7 0-0 £ic6 (7...dxc4 — Game No.55) 8 a3 Axc3 9 bxc3 dxc4 10 Axc4 #c7 This is one of the opening tabijas, the han¬ dling of which determined the class of a player at that time. For richness of content it is com¬ parable with the classical set-ups in the Span¬ ish or the Queen's Gambit. The basic conflict in the position is determined by the problem¬ atic material balance ‘two bishops against 254 Anatoly the Twelfth bishop and knight’. Each side has his pluses (White’s big pawn mass in the centre in return for the free development of Black’s pieces and his defect-free pawn structure), which makes the outcome dependent only on the mastery of the two players. In our day the evaluations of many opening variations depend on the subtleties of the struggle of two bishops against bishop and knight 11±d3 At that time the most fashionable continua¬ tion. Botvinnik considered 11 Jte2 to be more interesting, but this is a matter of taste. After 11.. .e5 12 #c2 Iid8 13 Ab2 Ag4\ 14 dxe5% 4}xe5 15 c4 a model game is Khalifman- Kramnik (Linares 2000), which incorporates the most typical middlegame features: 15.. .^x£3+ 16 gxf3 Ah?> 17 flfdl Wc6! 18 ®c3 £k8 19 <&>hl Ae6 20 Hgl f6! 21 Hg3 Hd7 22 flagl fiad8 23 Art A(5\ 24 e4 ±g6 25 h4 4ic7 with an excellent game for Black. 11 JLa2 is also often played, as, say, in Gel- fand-Korchnoi (Game No.46). And in recent times 11 Jk,b2 e5 12 h3 has been popular, when after 12...e4 13 4kl2 4ia5 14 jk,a2 Jtf5 15 c4! Sfe8 16 d5 £>d7 17 £41 ex£3 18 #xf3 Jtg6 19 h4! White seizes the initiative (Kram- nik-Tiviakov, Wijk aan Zee 2001), and there¬ fore 12..Jtf5 13 Hfe2 Had8 is better, maintaining the tension in the centre. 11.. .e5 12#c2 Se8 In the first Petrosian-Spassky match (20th matchgame, Moscow 1966) Black lost a tempo — 12..Jtg4 13 ^hxc5 £}xe5 14 dxe5 ®xe5 15 £3 Jtd7, and after 16 a4 White seized the initiative. 13 £>xe5 The sharp variation 13 e4 exd4 14 cxd4 jtg4! (Bronstein-Euwe, Zurich Candidates 1953) merely demonstrates the solidity of Black’s defences and may lead to a pretty draw by perpetual check: 15 Wxc5 itxf3 16 gxf3 Wd7! 17 Ac3 £ke4 18 Axc4 Hxe4 19 fxe4 %4+.

Apparendy, my series of seven successive wins in that tournament was destined to be broken... And yet a quarter of a century earlier this variation had been analysed by the Azer¬ baijan junior team, and I knew the correct prescription: 21...4)f8!! 22 We4?! f5! 23 Wh4 Sxh7 24 Wf6+ <4>e8 25 Ifel+ *d7 26 2e5 <4>c8 27 Axd4 cxd4 28 #xf5+ 4>b8. In the final position things are difficult for White, and my team-mate R.Tavadian won a game in this way in the All-Union Schoolchildren’s Spartakiad (1974). He remembered perfectly well ‘what to do’, whereas my memory unex¬ pectedly let me down! After 21...<A)f8 White has to think in terms of a draw, and it is still attainable: 22 Jlxd4 flxd4 23 Hfcl fih4 (23...b6 24 <4>g2) 24 fcc5+ etc. 13...^xe5 14 dxe5 »xe5 15 f3 ±e6 16 e4 16...Sad8 Another way to equalise was later demon¬ strated by Spassky in his match with Portisch (4th matchgame, Geneva 1977): 16...c4 17 Ac2 Wc5+ 18 *hl £>d7 19 Af4 b5. 255 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 17 Ae2 The time to advance — 17 f4?! Wc7 18 e5 — has not yet come: after 18...c4 19 jte2 Wc5+ 20 *hl ±g4! 21 Jtxg4 ^xg4 22 Sbl b6 23 h3 £ih6 Black’s position is clearly better. 17.. .b6 18 a4 In the first instance White needs to activate his dark-squared bishop, which has no oppo¬ nent, but this is not easy to do: 18 Ae3 £id5!, while if 18 c4 Black can choose between the double-edged 18...#d4+ 19 ihl #xal 20 ±b2 Wxfl+ 21 Axfl 22 a4 £ib8, and the more solid 18...^h5 19 Jtb2 ®g5 20 ihl 21 Afl h5 22 *hl h4. 18.. .Ad7 19 Sdl ±c6 20 flxd8 Sxd8 21 Jte3 h6! (of course, not 21...^3d5P 22 ®d2! tfxc3 23 Sdl!) 22 ±f2 ^h5 White has retained the two bishops, but he has not managed to activate them, and so there is no question of him having any advan¬ tage. Black’s position is solid, whereas White’s pawn islands on the queenside may become a source of concern. Karpov, having no experi¬ ence of playing such positions, continues to carry out a plan which appears to promise an advantage... 23 g3 From this point onwards a certain superfi¬ ciality is apparent in Karpov’s decisions, as a result of which his opponent’s active possibili¬ ties increase little by little, although for the moment the dynamic balance is not disturbed. Simple equality would have been retained by 23 Idl lxdl+ 24 Axdl (Kotov), or 23 ±fl ZhiA 24 JLg3 g5 (Botvinnik). 23.. .g5! An unexpected and brilliant reply. It tran¬ spires that the threat of f3-f4 is a phantom, whereas the weakening of the f3-e4 pawn pair is a reality. 24«&,b5 White now needs to devote some attention to defence. Thus 24 ffdl 2xdl+ 25 Wxdl would have handed the initiative to Black: 25.. .g4! 26 Wd&f *g7 27 Wh4 gx£3 28 Axf3 £if6 29 Jte3 h5, whereas getting rid of his weak pawn by 24 a5 g4 25 axb6 axb6 would have maintained parity. 24.. .Jtb7! 25 Sdl Again White does not prevent the prepara¬ tion of ...g5-g4. The same exchange of rooks after the preparatory 25 a5 g4 would have en¬ sured a simple draw: 26 Udl 2xdl+ 27 ®xdl gxf3 28 axb6 axb6 29 ttd8+ *4>g7 30 ®xb6 Wxc3 31 *xc5 Wxc5 32 Axc5 Axe4. 25.. .2.d1 + 26 #xd1 26...£tf6! An excellent decision. If White allows ...g5- g4, the e4-pawn may fall, exposing the long light-squared diagonal, on which the bishop at b7 will dominate. And Karpov faltered... 27 g4 This desire to suppress the threat is too risky, whereas 27 a5 would still have prevented it (27...g4? 28 a6!) and enabled White to main¬ tain equality without difficulty: 27...<4?g7 28 a6 256 Anatoly the Twelfth Ac8 29 ttd8 Ae6 30 #<13 g4 31 ±c6 gxB 32 WxB, or 27...bxa5 28 1^8+ <4>g7 29 Wxa5 ^3xe4. 28 Ag3? And this is a serious mistake, which places White on the verge of defeat. The incautious 28 HU8+ 4^7 29 Wc7? was bad on account of 29.. .1rxB! 30 *xb7 4kg4 31 ±g3 <S3e3 (Tal), and only by driving the queen away from the B-pawn — 28 Jlel! could White have main¬ tained the balance: 28...1ft2 29 ±g?> 4>g7 30 »d6. 28.. .4g7! 29 ±e2 The queen exchange 29 Wd3 Wxd3 30 jtxd3 would have eliminated the threat to the B-pawn, but 30...JLc6! would have forced White either to go in for a new, unfavourable exchange — 31 Jtb5 Jtxb5 32 axb5, when af¬ ter 32...4M7 he has an unpleasant endgame (for example, 33 4>f2 4^6 34 f4 ^f8! 35 4e3 £ie6 36 fxg5+ hxg5 37 ±bS £if8! 38 e5 4e6 39 ±x2l7 *hd7 40 4e4 f6! and wins), or allow Black to create two connected passed pawns after 31 a5 <$M7! 29...&C6? The key moment of the game, and possibly of the entire match! After conducting a com¬ plicated middlegame splendidly and gaining real winning chances, Spassky commits a blunder — a one-move oversight. Black would have gained a great and appar¬ ently decisive advantage by 29...h5! White cannot maintain his defensive construction. since 30 h3? is met by the crushing 30...4}xe4!, while here the saving counterattack 30 Wd6 does not in fact save him: 30...hxg4 31 Ae5 Wel+ 32 ±ft We3+ 33 <4>hl Wx£3+ 34 ±g2 Wf2 35 Wxf6+ #xf6 36 J.xf6+ <4>xf6 37 e5+ 4xe5 38 Jtxb7 c4 and wins (Tal). All that remains is to go into an endgame — 30 Jtel Wb2 31 gxh5!

This thrust, creating the terrible threat of 31 ±e5, was obviously missed by Spassky. He is forced to exchange queens immediately, losing all hopes of success. 30...®d4+ 31 ®xd4 cxd4 32 a5! bxa5! After 32...15M7 33 axb6 axb6 34 ±f2 it is not easy to draw against the awakened bish¬ ops.

Of course, this missed opportunity vexed and disappointed Spassky. Even so, being at that time the most experi¬ enced match fighter in the world, he was able to compose himself and arrive at the next game still full of optimism. This was another important, key game. On the 23rd move Kar¬ pov gave his opponent another surprise... ‘Even when I levelled the score, Spassky still did not understand what was happening and he remained in a state of Olympian cer¬ tainty of his own superiority and overall suc¬ cess,’ Karpov recalls. ‘Only the 6th game awakened him. I realised this from looking at him: this was already a different Spassky — seriously wounded, flustered, not understand¬ ing what was happening.’ 257 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Game 60 B.Spassky-A.Karpov Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 6th game Caro-Kann Defence B18 1 e4 c6 (of course!) 2 d4 d5 3 4hc3 dxe4 4 £ixe4 Af5 5 4hg3 l,g6 6 £if3 (6 h4! - GameNo.62) 6...4bd7 7 J.d3 e6 8 0-0 £igf6 9 c4 Ad6 10 b3 0-0 11 Ab2 #c7 Or ll...c5 12 jtxg6 hxg6 13 lei Wc7 14 dxc5 Jtxc5 15 Wc2 lfd8 16 £}e4 £}xe4 17 ®xe4 V2-V2 (2nd game). 12 l,xg6 hxg6 13 We2 Sfe8 14 ®e4 5}xe4 15 Wxe4 Spassky’s opening repairs had clearly been delayed, and for already the third "White’ game he was forced to play a tedious role in an alien scenario. To force the opponent to play what he does not like is a great achievement in a match struggle. The resulting middlegame does not prom¬ ise any great adventures. Neither side has any weaknesses, or any difficulties in the devel¬ opment of their forces. For the moment no clashes are anticipated, and unhurried ma¬ noeuvring is perfectly logical. , 15.. .±e7 Black continues his waiting strategy, em¬ phasising the solidity of his position. He even avoids the logical freeing move 15...e5. If now 16 c5, then Botvinnik’s suggestion 16...Jte7! 17 £\xe5 <S^xe5 18 dxe5 Jtxc5 is good, while after 16 ffael! ^f6 17 Wh4 one can agree with Karpov’s opinion that White has a slight initiative, although after 17...e4 18 £}g5 ilf4 19 Se2 e3! 20 fite3 (20 £3 b5! 21 g3 i.xg5 22 Wxg5 bxc4 23 bxc4 Wh6 24 Jtc3 ®a6 with equality) 20...flxe3 21 2ef2 Jtxg5 22 ttxg5 He7! it gradually fades: 23 Wh4 Sae8 24 flxf6 gxf6 25 d5 g5 26 tT2 cxd5 27 Axf6 He6 28 cxd5 fld6 29 JLxg5 Sxd5. 16 ladl 2ad8 17 Ifel Wa5! This activation could also have been carried out after 17...itf6 18 Jicl (if now 18...e5, then Botvinnik’s reply 19 itb2! is strong): 18...tta5 19 a4 WG with equality. 18a3#f5 19 #e2 After the exchange of queens White has no chances of an advantage, but now it transpires that the manoeuvre of the black queen was a link in an elegant activation plan. 19.. .g5!20h3 Spassky made this move very quickly, de¬ ferring the d4-d5 breakthrough until better times. And indeed, after 20 d5 exd5 White is not promised any benefits by either 21 £id4 Wh7 (or 21...We4! Botvinnik) 22 cxd5 cxd5 23 Wb5 jtd6!, or 21 cxd5 g4! (Karpov) 22 £>d4 ®xd5 23 ttrxg4 £if6. 20.. .g4 21 hxg4 ®xg4 22 d5?! At first sight a timely advance, since after the double pawn exchange it will be advanta¬ geous for White to give up his queen for two 258 Anatoly the Twelfth rooks. Karpov’s evaluation was very deep: "White’s position is slightly freer thanks to the c4-d4 pawn pair, but the opening of the centre deprives him of this, perhaps his only plus. 22 fid3 Jtf6 23 fie3 was better.’ I think, never¬ theless, that here too after 23... Wh5 one can talk about equality. 22...cxd5 23 cxd5 23.. .e5!! One of the best moves in the match. I re¬ member it made an enormous impression on me. Its strength was deady underestimated by Spassky, who was possibly hoping for 23.. .JLd6? 24 dxe6 Sxe6 25 #xe6! fxe6 26 fixd6. Of course, the pawn sacrifice is only imagi¬ nary: 24 £lxe5?! ®xe2 25 Sxe2 Jtd6 26 fldel ^xe5 27 Jtxe5 JLxa3, but Black leaves his opponent with a seemingly powerful passed pawn in the centre. Alas, only seemingly: it will be securely blocked by the knight, and in the endgame it will become an appredable weak¬ ness. This method of ‘circumventing’ a passed d6-pawn in the Griinfeld Defence was one that I used in my Seville match against Karpov (1987), but for the mid-1970s such an inter¬ pretation was a revelation, an important step forward in the understanding of chess. 24 d6!? After 24 WbS there is a very simple way to equalise: 24..Jtc5! 25 4}xe5 4lxe5 26 jtxe5 ±,xf2+! 27 4>xf2 fixe5 28 Ixe5 Wf4+ 29 <4>gl #xe5. 24.. JLf6 25 £>d2?l Again Spassky is inferior to his opponent in his evaluation of the position — in matchplay such a thing is dispiriting and takes away your confidence. He overestimates the strength of the d6-pawn and avoids the equal middlegame after 25 Wb5, where his passed pawn would have restricted Black’s forces, for example: 25.. .e4 26 £>h2 We6 27 Axf6 £kf6 28 Wxb7 fld7 29 Wb4 thd5 30 Wc5 Sxd6. In the end¬ game, however, it is transformed into ballast! But in order to show this, great accuracy is required of Black, and Karpov displays this. 25.. .#xe2 26 !xe2 lc8! 27 ®e4 Again a questionable decision: White drives the bishop to d8, where it is ready for play on both flanks. It would have been better to block the c-file by 27 £k4! Jtg5 28 a4 and to maintain equality after 28...f6 29 g3 ^f7 30 ^g2, since it is hard for Black to strengthen his position. ^ 27.. .JLd8 28 g4 f6 29 i>g2 <i?f7 30 Hcl?! Karpov attaches an exclamation mark to this move: control of the c-file! But Tal logi¬ cally objects: "White should not have ex¬ changed a pair of rooks: although he now oc¬ cupies the c-file, there are no invasion squares there for the rook The immediate 30 a4 should have been considered. With all four rooks on the board, it would be dangerous for the black king to approach the d6-pawn on account of the threat of f2-f4.’ 259 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 30.. JLb6 31 fiec2 Hxc2 32 Sxc2 ie6 33 a4 White decides to include his bishop in the defence of the d6-pawn. The advance of the other pawn promised less: 33 b4 a5 34 bxa5 JtxaS 35 ig3 b5, or 33...*d5 34 *£3 g6 35 JSd2+ jtd4 36 ®g3 2c8. 33.. .a5! This is by no means prophylaxis, but the start of a deep plan of playing for a win. White has no way of strengthening his position, but the same cannot be said about Black 34 J.a3 2b8! It turns out that Karpov is preparing ...b7- b5, which is hard to prevent. Thus if 35 £k3?! the rook advantageously turns back — 35.. .flc8. 35 Hc4! The rook wants to help the knight carry out the manoeuvre e4-c3-b5. There is still no other, more fitting work for it on the c-file. 35.. .Ad4! 36 f4! After the direct 36 4}c3 Black would have gained the advantage by 36...£}b6 37 JSc7 Jtxc3 38 flxc3 £k!5 39 flc5 b6 40 Sc2 b5. 36.. .g6 Black has to agree to the exchange of ap>air of pawns, since in the event of 36...b5 37 axb5 fixb5 White succeeds in carrying out an even more favourable exchanging operation: 38 f5+ ‘idS 39 ^c3+! Jlxc3 40 Hxc3, gaining excel¬ lent drawing chances. 37 £>g3?! After the logical 37 fxe5 JtxeS 38 Sc7 it would have been not so easy for Black to demonstrate the reality of his advantage.

After the more subtle 38...b6! 39 g5! f5 40 ^d2 the use of the computer as a guiding sparring-partner can lead to an amusing draw- ing finale: 40...b5 41 b4 42 Hxd7 bxa3 43 Se7+ 'S?xd6 44 Sxe5 a2 45 Bel Bxb3 46 Sal Sb2+ 47 4>g3 *c5 48 £k5 *b4 49 <2lxg6 *b3 50 £>f4 Sbl 51 Sxa2 -4>xa2 52 g6 -4>a3 53 g7 Hb8 54 <§3e6 Sg8 55 <&f4 -4>xa4 56 -4>xf5 *b4 57 -4>f6 ^c4 58 &f4 a4 59 -§3e2 <*d3 60 £lcl+ *c2 61 &a2 <£b2 62 -§3b4 a3 63 i*f7 Sb8 64 gttW Sxg8 65 'A'xgS i*b3 66 260 Anatoly the Twelfth £>d3 <4>c3 67 Ski <4>c2 68 Sk2 <4>b3 69 £kl+ *b2 70 <Sld3+. However, 40...iLf4! 41 S3f3 Jte3 nevertheless leaves Black with chances of success. 37.. .exf4! Again Karpov squeezes the maximum out of the situation. After the natural 37...b5 38 f5+ gxf5 39 gxf5+ ‘idS White would have gained a draw: 40 Hc7 b4 41 JLxb4 Bxb4 42 flxd7 Sxb3 43 £ih5! e4 44 He7 (Spassky), or 40.. .bxa4!? 41 bxa4 Ib3 42 flxd7 flxa3 43 <53hS e4 44 He7 Ha2+ 45 4h3 4xd6 46 flxe4 idS 47 He6. 38 lxd4 fxg3 39 ixg3 Sc8 (control of the c-file has passed to Black, and this immedi¬ ately makes the defence more difficult) 40 Hd3 40...g5! I think that Spassky must have underesti¬ mated the strength of this move, the last one before the time control. Black secures a solid post for his knight at eS and prepares to play ...b7-b5. Although there is very litde material left on the board, it is not easy for White to defend. 41 ±b2 b6 42 ±d4 In the analysis of the adjourned position 42 flc3 provoked arguments among the experts. Karpov's recommendation 42...Sh8 can hardly give Black anything. There only remains the exchange of rooks — 42..JSxc3-l- 43 iLxc3. Now the endgame after 43...£k5 44 if3 ^3xb3 45 d7 ixd7 46 Jtxf6 $3c5 47 JlxgS <S3xa4 48 ie4 was rightly judged by Botvinnik to be drawn, since the knight will be unable to help the king with the advance of the pawns, for example: 48...4c6 49 4d4 £k5 50 ±e3 b5 51 g5 4fe6 52 4c3 4d5 53 g6. Botvinnik (like all the later commentators) also considered the ending arising after 43...4xd6 44 b4 to be drawn.

In the diagram position no one noticed the pretty 44...b5!l, enabling Black to create a dangerous passed pawn.

The win is more difficult when the white pawn is more remote — 45 bxa5 bxa4: 1) if 46 a6 4c7 47 4*0 Black wins most simply by 47...£ie5+ 48 4e4 <53xg4 49 4f5 £ih6+!, for example: 50 4xf6 g4 51 jtd4 a3 52 4g5 a2 53 4f4 4c6 54 a7 4b7 55 ±al 4xa7 56 4g3 4b6, or 50 4g6 g4 51 4xh6 261 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors g3 52 &h5 g2 53 ±d4 a3 54 &g4 a2; 2) a fascinating race of two black pawns can be observed in the event of 46 'A’f3 £k5+! 47 li,e4 £)xg4 with the sequel 48 a6 'A’c6 49 'S?f5 <§3h6+! 50 &xf6 g4 51 4>g5 a3! 52 J.d4 g3 53 &f4 g2 54 'A’B £)B, or the somewhat more complicated 48 *f5 <53e3+ 49 &e4 <§3d5 50 ±b2 &e6! 51 a6 f5+ 52 4>B <53c7 53 a7 &d5 54 i.cl (54 J.f6 g4 55 a3 55 4>xf5 g3 56 ±c5 a2!) 54...f4! 55 Ab2 £>a8! 56 Aa3 4>e5 57 <4>g4 4>e4! 58 ±c5 £3 59 &g3 g4 60 4>f2 idS 61 ,S.e7 <4’c4 62 <4^3 <44)3 and wins; 3) the win is the most difficult if White tries by 46 Jtb4+ <4>c6 47 4?B not to allow the black pawn to reach a3.

But in the event of 54 <4)d3 he has to find the study-like 54...^3a3!l, preventing the king from approaching the a2-pawn.

All the commentators thought that the pawn capture 43...Sxd6 44 fixd6+ 4>xd6 would have allowed White good drawing chances after 45 b4. It is probable that both players came to the same conclusion in their adjournment analysis. However, 45...b5! leads to the position that was examined earlier. Thus a serious analytical error could have can¬ celled out the results of Black’s previous fine play. 44 2c8 45 ^g3 £>e5! 46 l,xe5 fxe5 Evidently judging the bishop vs. knight ending to be drawn, Karpov pins his hopes on the rook ending — and he is not mistaken, as shown by the following mistake, the home’ origin of which was also quite probable. 47 b4?

Karpov took the lead: 2-1. There is no doubt that the ex-champion’s mistakes in the 5th game and especially the 6th undermined his belief in success and brought the ultimate finish closer. After missing a draw on the resumption of the 6th game, the distressed Spassky was com¬ pletely outplayed in the 7fh,’ writes Roshal. ‘Either the closeness of the desired conclusion affected Karpov, or else his youth told: at one point he made an impulsive decision, and in the adjourned position he no longer had a win.’ Game 61 A.Karpov-B.Spassky Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 7th game Dutch Defence A85 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 3 c6 4 e3 f5 In his search for schemes unfamiliar to his opponent, Spassky placed his choice on the strategically risk ‘stonewall’ set-up, which had not previously occurred in his games. And again his choice proved unsuccessful. Spassky nullified his advantage in the experience of playing typical middlegame positions, and Kar¬ pov was able to handle a standard position in this variation by using general considerations. 5 f4 ‘Karpov remains faithful to his manner of play — in the first instance to restrict his oppo¬ nent’s possibilities.’ (Botvinnik) 5...4if6 6 £tf3 ±e7 7 ±e2 0-0 8 0-0 £ie4 Botvinnik considered the knight leap into the centre to be over-hasty and suggested im¬ mediately making the bishop manoeuvre jtc8- d7-e8-h5(g6): 8...±d7 9 £k5 ±eS. Nearly 20 263 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors years later Karpov again played this line, and Black equalised by solving the problem of his bishop’s development in another way: 8...b6 9 Wc2 Ab7 10 cxd5 cxd5 11 Ad2 ^c6 12 a3 £le4 13 Ifcl fic8 14 iTdl #d7 15 Ael flc7 16 fic2 ^xc3 17 Hxc3 Sfc8 18 fiacl Ad6 19 Wz4 £ib8 (Karpov-Ivanchuk, Tilburg 1993). 9 Wc2£id7 10 b3 £ixc3 Instead of this also premature exchange, which merely restricts Black’s possibilities, he should have played 10...£klf6. 11 #xc3 £rf6 12 foeSl Ad7 This seemingly natural move allows White to prepare the advantageous exchange of the dark-squared bishops. The manoeuvre of the bishop via e8 to h5 should have been made after prophylaxis — 12...Ad6 13 a4 We7! 13 a4! £le4?! (this move, the fruit of half an hour’s thought, was condemned by Botvinnik, who thought that activity in the centre with 13...c5 was preferable) 14 ®d3! 14...Af6? Black decides to give up his bishop for the formidable knight, but after this the white bishop becomes complete master of the dark- squared diagonals! The variation 14...Ae8 15 Aa3 ilxa3 16 fixa3 a5 17 Af3 would also have led to an unpromising situation where, apart from his spatial advantage, White would have the possibility of attacking the oppo¬ nent’s central outpost with his bishop, whereas Black would have to reconcile himself to an ‘eternal’ knight at e5. Therefore 14...c5 was now necessary, initi¬ ating play in the centre and activating the pas¬ sive bishop at d7. After 15 cxd5 exd5 16 dxc5 ^xc5 17 Wxd5+ Ae6 18 ®xd8 Sfxd8 19 Ac4 Axc4 20 bxc4 Sac8 Black would have compensation for the pawn, while in the event of 16 Aa3 Ae6 17 dxc5 £\xc5 18 Wdl £ie4 19 Axe7 ®xe7 20 Wd4 fifc8 White would retain an obvious positional advantage, but Black’s position would be quite tenable. 15Aa3Be8 Hopes of creating counterplay were prom¬ ised by an operation in the centre: 15...dxc4 16 bxc4?l c5 17 AG Axe5 18 fxe5 Ac6, but 16 ^xc4! c5 17 Sadi would have immediately extinguished Black’s activity. 16 Ah5! g6 ‘Now Spassky’s light-squared bishop is se¬ verely restricted, and after the inevitable open¬ ing of the h-file the g6-pawn will become a good target for White to attack.’ (Botvinnik). In addition, two more dark squares are weak¬ ened — f6 and h6. 17 Af3 JLxeB ‘This leads to a lost position.’ (Botvinnik). But 17...b5, a suggestion by the master Cherepkov to activate the sleeping bishop, would not have solved Black’s problems after the cool-headed 18 Axe4! dxe4 19 1§e2. 18 dxe5! h5 Forestalling g2-g4, but Karpov emphasises the drawbacks of this advance with a timely exchange. 264 Anatoly the Twelfth 19 Jtxe4! fxe4 (after 19...dxe4?

Spassky decides to try and divert the oppo¬ nent from carrying out his plan, and Karpov — perhaps wrongly — decides to take a pawn which was merely preventing Black from co¬ ordinating his pieces. 27 #xb7 ±e8 28 #b4 laa7! 29 Bg2 29 ®b6!

The realisation that his position was won prevented Karpov from calmly evaluating the situation’ — and after relaxing he transposed moves in his in¬ tended plan. The safest and strongest way was the timely exchange 32 cxd5!, forcing Black to open the c-file: 32...cxd5 (32...exd5? 33 e6!) 33 JLb6 WbB 34 flcl with an extra pawn and an enormous positional advantage. 32.. .Wd7 33 cxd5 exd5! The queen, after being driven to d7, has made this capture possible, and White unex¬ pectedly has to think about the safety of his king. 34 g4 hxg4 35 hxg4 Tal suggested that Karpov went in for this position, considering it to be won on account of the unavoidable f4-f5. 35.. .gxf4! The opening of the position is Black’s only chance. The degree of risk does not play any role — things can’t be any worse than they are. 36 exf4 Ih4 37 f5 Sfh7 For the first time in the game Black has gained the opportunity to create some threats, and Karpov, realising his error, became nerv¬ ous and sank into thought for 15 minutes. The decision he came to was by no means the best and probably indicates that he was somewhat rattled. 38 e6? It is hard to condemn a move made in time-trouble. It all seems correct: yes, the 265 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors black queen gains the prospect of a raid into White’s position, but Karpov has planned a manoeuvre aimed at ensuring the safety of his king. However, the idea proves to have a flaw. Meanwhile, in the nervy atmosphere that had suddenly arisen on the board, the bold removal of the king from the danger zone — 38 ^£Z\ — would have given White good win¬ ning chances.

It is surprising, but this square is the most comfortable shelter for the king. Here it not at all easy to get at — at any event, I was unable to do so in my analysis. And meanwhile the white pawns are ready to begin advancing... 38..M66 39 %3 The computer optimistically evaluates the position after 39 Jte3!? Sh2 40 Wd2, calculat¬ ing (I stress the word 'calculating1) that White still has winning chances. However, it is not easy for me to confirm this, even after making an analysis, which, incidentally, it is difficult to do in this position, because of the abundance of possibilities for both sides. 39...Shi + 40 4?f2 #b4! (unexpectedly it transpires that this manoeuvre saves Black) 41 #e3 (the sealed move) %-K The players agreed a draw without resuming the game. Indeed, in this sharp position neither side can afford to take a risk, and analysis shows that a draw is inevitable. The finish to this splen¬ did chess thriller could have been: 41...fllh3 42 Sg3 Sh2+ 43 Hg2 S2h3 44 %5+. Analysis diagram The last test before acknowledging the draw. 44...fig7? looks very tempting, especially since in the event of the obvious 45 ®d8?

On the other hand, after 45 ®cl! it transpires that Black has moved his rook to g7 in vain. The main threat is 46 f6 (for example, 45...d4 46 f61), and no effective way of parrying it is apparent. In the variation 45...flc3 46 Wd2 l£3f 47 <&>gl! (47 *el Ic3!) 47...Wxd2 48 ffxd2 flxg4+ 49 Ig2 White loses a pawn, but the inevitable f5-f6 will cost Black his bishop. But after 44...&h&\ White, not making the same mistake twice (45 Sdl? c5!, and it is Black who wins!), gives perpetual check — 45 Wf6+ <&>g8 46 ®g5+. This was the prelude to the last turning point in the match: fate granted Spassky a mi- 266 Anatoly the Twelfth raculous escape and a chance finally to try and breach the super-solid Caro-Kann Defence. He arrived for the 8th game in a fighting mood, but his young opponent did not lose his customary composure and again showed himself to be a brilliant defender. Game 62 B.Spassky-A.

In the 4th game after 10...e6 Spassky em¬ ployed a fresh idea — 11 b3 4igf6 12 Jtb2. Kar¬ pov’s reaction was forceful — 12...®a5+! 13 ±c3 (13 c3 Aa3) 13. JLb4 14 ±xb4 #xb4+ 15 Wd2 Wxd2+ 16 <4)xd2 c5 with equality. 11 &d2 On this occasion, evidently not wanting a discussion in what were then the main lines of the Caro-Kann, Spassky had prepared another rare move. As for 11 Jtf4, after ll...Wa5+ at the end of the 1970s the Latvian master Vito- lins found the curious plan 12 c3 e6 13 a4!? and 14 b4 (removing the attack on the h5- pawn) followed by 0-0. This did not look too convincing and by the 1980s it was not longer topical. Following the example of Larsen, Black adopted more dynamic set-ups with castling on opposite sides — ll...e6!? 12 0-0-0 JLe7 and nevertheless ...0-0. In current tour¬ nament practice this is the dominant ap¬ proach. 11 ..Mc7 12 c4 The usual way is 12 0-0-0 e6 13 Wc2 and 4ie5 (following the source game: Spassky- Petrosian, 13th matchgame, Moscow 1966) or 13 4ie4 — this move is considered the strong¬ est even today (Volume 2, Game No. 145). By beginning active play before castling, Spassky wants to gain something in this way. But what? 12...e6 13 We2 In Spassky-Portisch (9th matchgame, Mex¬ ico 1980) White reverted to the banal 13 0-0-0, when 13...0-0-0 14 ±c3 c5 15 4>bl cxd4 16 £txd4 a6 led to a position which, al- beit with the pawn on h4, had occurred be¬ tween the same opponents back in Budapest 1961! 267 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 13.. JLd6! After 13...0-0-0 Black may have been afraid of 14 c5 and a white pawn offensive on the queenside. This occurred soon afterwards in the game Karpov-Hort (Ljubljana 1975), but Hort cleverly created counterplay: 14.. .fig8! 15 b4 g6 16 Hbl gxh5 17 <4>fl fig4 18 flb3 *b8 19 £\xh5 £\xh5 20 fixh5 £lf6 21 fie5 ±g7 22 b5 ^d5 etc. But Spassky may have been in¬ tending 14 £le5. Either way, 13..Jk,d6! is still considered best 14 £\f5 ±f4 The game Karpov-Pomar (Nice Olympiad 1974) went 14...0-0-0? 1 15 £kd6+ tfxd6 16 jta5! fide8 17 £ie5! and Black came under pressure. The fact that Anatoly began playing this variation with White indicates his high evaluation of Spassky's idea! Obviously he was also not satisfied with Black’s position in the present game. But about that later. Here it should be said that the most inter¬ esting of the lines along which the variation developed turned out to be 14,..0-0! 15 £ixd6 #xd6. Analysis diagram Thanks to his kingside (rather than queen- side) castling, Black acquires a powerful re¬ source in the fight for the initiative: ...b7-b5! This idea was first tried in 1975 in a game be¬ tween two Leningrad masters: 16 0-0-0 b5! 17 cxb5 cxb5 18 Ahl b4 19 <5^e5 ^d5, with seri¬ ous chances for Black on the queenside. I too twice played this with Black (on the advice of my trainer Alexander Shakarov). My oppo¬ nents avoided queenside castling, but all the same they conceded the initiative: 16 fih4 b5! 17 *fl bxc4 18 #xc4 Wd5 19 We2 Wb5 20 b3 a5 (Lanka-Kasparov, Riga 1977), or 16 ±c3 b5! 17 cxb5 cxb5 18 Wxb5 £id5 19 £ie5 &xe5 (19...£>7f6!?) 20 dxe5 ^xc3 21 bxc3 Wc7 (Kapengut-Kasparov, Daugavpils 1978). Therefore 16 0-0-0 is nevertheless better, and if 16...b5 — 17 g4! In the game Mnatsa- kanian-Bagirov (Kirovakan 1978) after 17...bxc4 (though not now topical, 17...4ixg4!? 18 fihgl f5 is also worth analysing) 18 g5 hxg5 19 h6 g6 20 h7+ 4hdi7 21 ^xg5 ^xg5 22 Axg5 f6? 23 We4 White gained a very strong attack, but 22...c3! would probably have led to a draw: 23 We5!? cxb2+ 24 ^bl #xe5! 25 dxe5 f6 26 fixd7 £xg5 27 fihh7. 15 i.xf4#xf4 16£\e3 16.. .#07?! Tt was dangerous to play 16...0-0-0 17 c5 with the threat of ^c4-d6+. Therefore the correct solution was the undermining move 16.. .c5!, and if 17 <SM5 ^xd5 18 cxd5, then 18.. .0.0 19 dxe6 Bfe8.’ (Botvinnik). For ex¬ ample: 20 0-0 fixed 21 WbS Wc7... 1/2-1/2 (Tal- Portisch, Bugojno 1978). The same operation as that planned by Karpov could have been begun immediately: 16.. .b5!? 17 cxb5 (or 17 d5 cxd5 18 ^xd5 £kd5 19 exd5 0-0 20 dxe6 fiae8) 17...cxb5 18 Wxb5 0-0 with sufficient counterplay. 268 Anatoly the Twelfth After the loss of just one tempo, Karpov will not quite be able to equalise for a long time. Even so, the defensive resources in the position prove sufficient for him to withstand a powerful attack. 17 0-0-0 b5 The white king (in contrast to Black’s) has moved away from the centre, and the active 17.. .c5? is now dangerous: 18 £kl5! £ixd5 19 cxd5 cxd4+ 20 *bl e5 21 £>xd4 0-0 22 £lf5 and wins (Botvinnik). 18 cxb5! After the tempting 18 c5 there is again a choice between 18...Hd8 19 A’bl 0-0 20 g4 £te4 and 18...0-0-0 19 *bl *b7 20 £>c2 £>d5 with roughly equal chances. Spassky is intending a grandiose offensive plan, righdy assuming that the black king has nowhere to hide, apart from the kingside. 18.. .cxb5+ 19 &b1 0-0 20 g4! The opening of the g-file is the main link in White’s attack. 20 WxbSP! Sab8 would have signified him rejecting activity and going onto the defensive. After 21 Wc2 Black has a wide choice of promising continuations: 21...Hb4 22 flcl Wb7 23 Sc2 2b8 or even the simple 21.. .Hxb2+ 22 Wxb2 Sb8. 21 Wd3 Wb7 22 Hd2 is better, but here too Black has no rea¬ son for complaint: 22..JSfc8 23 Hc2 flxc2 24 Wxc2 flc8 25 Wd3 (25 #e2 £lxh5!) 25...&e4. 20.. .£te4 21 Ihgl 21 Hdgl?!, which is usual in such set-ups, would have allowed the opponent to slow the tempo of the attack by 21...lHrf4! (22 g5P? is not possible on account of 22...'Srxf3i). Kotov recommended the fanciful 21 ^g2, but this retreat is hardly able to strengthen the attack: 21.. .£Mf6 22 £ie5 Sac8 23 Hhel Hfd8 24 £3 £\d6. The immediate opening of lines would not have produced the desired effect — 21 g5 hxg5 (the consequences of 21...^xg5 22 £}xg5 hxg5 23 JSdgl f6 are also unclear) 22 ffiigl f6 23 d5 *hdc5 24 £id4 Hae8 25 &xb5 to with double-edged play. 21.. .<?bg5! (preventing the opening of the g- file; if 21 ...to?, then 22 g5! &xg5 23 £>xg5 hxg5 24 Sg4 #f6 25 ®xb5 is strong) 22 ®xg5 hxg5 23 d5! White is again not interested in the b5- pawn — only in an attack! ‘Could Spassky have believed that his opponent would be able to defend his broken position?’ writes Botvinnik, who considered 23 ®xb5 to be necessary. Dvoretsky is of the same opinion: ‘White has insufficient resources for a direct attack on the king (partly as a consequence of his knight being not altogether well placed on e3). He can fight for an advantage, only by temporarily conceding the initiative — by accepting the pawn sacrifice, for which his opponent gains definite, but nevertheless insufficient compen¬ sation: 23 Wxb5 fiab8 24 ®d3! (but not Bot- vinnik’s recommendation 24 We2? on account of 24...flxb2+! 25 Wxb2 fib8) with the idea of Sd2andScl.’ Even so, after 24...^b6! 25 fld2 (25 Scl to) 25...Sfc8!P Black could have hoped for good counterplay. 23...a6! Staggering composure! After 23...Hre5 24 dxe6 Wxe6 White could have grabbed the pawn without risk: 25 Wxb5 5^e5 26 Wd5. To spend time on the defence of a second-rate pawn when you are under fire, even if you have an excellent positional sense you also have to have great courage. 24 h6?! 269 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Consistent, but ineffective! The correct strategy was play in the centre: 24 dxe6 fxe6 25 £\c2! We5\ Analysis diagram After the natural 26 Wd2 the bold 26...£\c5! (26...£\f6?! 27 £3!) 27 Hgel Wf4 would have enabled Black both to defend the e6-pawn, and activate his pieces. It turns out that White should have primar¬ ily been guided by the opponent's broken pawn structure and threatened to go into a favourable endgame, which would have been achieved by 26 flgel! Black has two alterna¬ tives, but in both cases he would have had to solve some difficult problems: 1) 26...Had8 27 £ib4 Wxe2 28 Hxe2 £>f6 29 Ixd8 Hxd8 30 £k6 (30 £3 Hd6!) 30...^xg4 31 foci; 2) 26...Wxe2 27 Hxe2 £k5 28 £kl!

Spassky’s choice, based on intuition and the motto "Forward, Kazimirych!’, is in fact an example of an unequal pawn exchange, which relieves Black of one of his weak pawns and deprives White of his h5-pawn, one which would be very important for the endgame. Alas, this became clear only after no brain¬ storms were able to demonstrate the strength of his attack And Spassky had to make his decision with the clock ticking... 24...gxh6! Another defensive scheme — 24...g6 25 dxe6 fxe6 was condemned by Tal on the basis of the variation 26 <53£51? Hae8? 27 h7+! <i’xh7 28 Hxd7+! Wxdl 29 Hhl+ <4>g8 30 We5, but Black would have parried the attack by activat¬ ing his queen: 26...®e5! 27 Wd2 ex£5 28 figel lff6 29 Wxd7 Had8 30 ®b7 flxdl+ 31 Hxdl Hf7, or 27 Wc2 exf5 28 fixd7 fiac8 29 Wd2 fxg4. Even so. White would have retained an advantage after the less spectacular 26 ficl! Wb7 (or 26...Wf4 27 Hgdl) 27 £tfl *h7 28 ^g3. Karpov is hoping that, during the time that White spends on winning the h6-pawn, he will be able to consolidate his position. 25 fihl It appears that Black is in trouble. 25...53f6! This strong move came as a surprise to Spassky, and he thought for nearly half an hour over his reply, leaving himself just 18 minutes for 14 moves. 25...<4>g7? looks the natural reaction, after which there would probably have followed the thunderous 26 f4H If 26...gxf4 Tal gives the fol¬ lowing winning variation: 27 ®h2 fih8 28 &Sg2 e5 29 £h4 £rf6 30 £>5+ ^g6 31 ficl lti8 32 270 Anatoly the Twelfth fic6, but if Black does not weaken his position for the sake of keeping his f4-pawn, then after 28.. 5Lac8l there is no dear way to win* And yet White's attack is irresistible, but for this he has to play very energetically and accu¬ rately! Thus the immediate and ‘obvious' 27 g5, in the hope of 27...h5? 28 dxe6 £xe6 29 ®>g4H with crushing threats (29..Mc6 30 Ixd7+!

Tal: The match was effectively concluded in the 8th game, when Spassky was unable to win it Personally I didn’t doubt for a second that after White began his attack with 24 h6 the game would soon come to a spec¬ tacular end. But after 25...£\f6 (Karpov made this move fairly quickly) no win could be found! Such a blow is even greater than a de¬ feat. When such positions cannot be won, you begin to lose confidence. All sorts of devilish thoughts creep into your mind, such as: is it altogether possible to win against him?’ In the 9th game a ‘reverse surprise’ waited the already pretty exhausted Spassky — an un¬ expected return to 1 e4! And here his indiffer¬ ent pre-match preparation again made itself felt: in the Sicilian Defence the ex-world champion did not have to his name even one secure and well-studied variation, correspond¬ ing to his active style of play. Karpov: When I played 1 e4, with a com¬ pletely vacant look Spassky suddenly began adjusting with both hands, for the second time, his already accurately placed pieces. He was nervous... It is probable that this blow too came as a surprise. The point is that, in con¬ trast to Fischer, who changed openings after comparative failures, I, on the contrary, avoided set-ups which had brought success. Thus in the 11th game I played 1 d4. It was probably rather difficult for Spassky to pre¬ pare for games with me.’ Game 63 A.Karpov-B.Spassky Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 9th game Sicilian Defence B83 1 e4 c5 2 £>f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 £ixd4 £>f6 5 £te3 d6 6 ±e2 ±e7 7 0-0 0-0 8 f4 £>c6 9 JLe3 9.. .1td7 Apparendy Spassky was somewhat flus¬ tered and just in case he decided to avoid 9.. .e5 10 £\b3 a5 11 a4 %Sb4 (1st game).

A strategically dubious move. Spassky is still aiming for the set-up which he had ana¬ lysed together with Bondarevsky. However, this was hardly a detailed analysis by the fol¬ lowers of the ‘clear head’ theory, as shown by the subsequent course of the game. The usual 272 Anatoly the Twelfth 10...a6 or 10...#c7 would have directed the game along the lines of the classical Scheveningen. 11 a4^b4 12±f3 ±c6 If 12...e5 the strongest has been considered to be 13 &hl, since the time of Geller’s games: 13..JSc8 14 Sf2 fic4 15 fxe5 dxe5 16 Bd2 ®c7 17 Wgl! with advantage (Geller- Reshevsky, Palma de Mallorca Interzonal 1970), or 13..Jtc6 14 fee5 dxe5 15 ®e2 #c7 16 lf£2 £}d7 17 Hadl *h8 (Gdler- Polugayevsky, Portoroz 1973) 18 fid2 fiad8 19 %3. Spassky is not in a hurry to free himself, but the opponent observes his preparations, realis¬ ing that ...e6-e5 is Black’s only chance. 13 ^d4! In contrast to the 1st game, the knight gains the opportunity to return to the centre, after which Black has no compensation for the op¬ ponent’s eternal outpost-for his pieces at b5.

Indeed, after 26 Ibl Ag3! (26...1rxg2+ 27 Axg2 £k3+ 28 <&>B ^xc4 29 b3 leads to an inferior endgame) Black has excellent compensation: 27 ®xc6 runs into 27.. .^el! with the threat of...Ah2+. However, 24 Sadi! (instead of 24 Hd7) 24.. .5fd8 25 Ixd8+ Sxd8 26 Sfl! was much stronger, and after 26...Id7 27 Axb4 axb4 28 Wxc6! We3+ 29 it would have left Black in a hopeless position: 29... Jtg3+ 30 Ahl Sa7 31 £>d5 We2 32 ®d5!, or 29...Id8 30 £>d5 ®e2 31 IB. Karpov, most probably intuitively, chose a plan of further strengthening the position, more in accordance with his style of play. 23.. .1fd8 24^b1! This fine ‘backwards move’ provoked a real stir in the press centre and in the auditorium. The knight is transferred to a better square at the most convenient moment. 24...®b7 The exchange of queens would have irrepa¬ rably weakened Black’s pawns and led to a technically lost endgame: 24...We6 25 Wxe6 fxe6 26 4^a3. 25 Ah2! Ag7 26 c3 (White also has an enormous advantage after 26 Ixd8!? Ixd8 27 £>d2) 26...^a6 Black has to withdraw to the edge of the board. The dashing cavalry raid 26...Ixd2,27 5ixd2 %3c2 28 Ac5 fails to save him: 29 Sxel Axel 30 %3£3 Wxb2 31 4ixel H?d2 32 £h& 1T4+ 33 Ahl Id8 34 Agl or, more methodically, 29 ^b3 ^d3 30 Wxd3 Wxb3 31 ®d6 ®e6 32 ®xe6 fke6 33 Idl Id8 34 Sxd8 Axd8 35 b4 with a won endgame. 27 le2! ‘Following the old Steinitz principle — don’t exchange pieces when you have the freer posi¬ tion. Now 28 g3 and Ief2 is threatened.’ (Botvinnik). The temporary conceding of the d-file is not dangerous - it is more important for White to retain the rook for his attack on the f-file and at the same time vacate the d2- square for his knight. 27...Sf8? Black should not have shown such indiffer¬ ence to the d-file. 27...Id6 28 $3d2 Ie8 was more tenacious, erecting defensive lines in the event of 29 W*2 Ad8 30 £>c4 Id7 31 lef2 f6. Now the direct assault 32 Ag5 ^c5 33 2 74 Anatoly the Twelfth Jtxf6+ Jtxf6 34 2xf6 wins material, but gives Black counterplay - 34...^xe4 35 4^xa5 Wcl 36 Se6 flde7 37 2xe7+ flxe7 38 b4 c5, but on the other hand 32 b3! leaves him under un¬ bearable positional pressure.

In general it is rather hard to surprise me, but Tolya did this, by spending no more than about five minutes on the dozen splendid concluding moves/ The score became 3-1 and Karpov needed just one more win. In the 10th game Spassky was ready to again try and storm the bastions of the Caro- Kann, but for the first time in the match Kar¬ pov replied l...e5, unafraid of playing the Breyer Variation in the Ruy Lopez - his op¬ ponent’s favourite defence. This was a chal¬ lenge! White soon closed the position with d4- d5 and gained an enduring initiative. Botvin- nik: 6A rare instance, when Karpov was forced to fight against his own domination method.’ Game 64 B.Spassky-A.Karpov Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974,10th game 32 Jta7!

Tal: eI will simply not undertake to annotate the final, 11th game. It is an exact copy of the 21st game of Spassky’s match with Fischer in Reykjavik. There Boris conducted all the con¬ cluding games with a kind of anguished pres¬ sure. He tried very, very hard... But it didn’t happen! No, he didn’t give up the match as a bad job — this happened of its own accord. It occurred sub-consciously: he is one of the those players who consciously does not re¬ sign... ‘Spassky’s condition is familiar to me: it was the same with me in the 21st game of my return match with Botvinnik. When I sat down at the board, I thought that, God will¬ ing, I would win... It didn’t happen! And with Spassky it didn’t happen, either against Fischer, or against Karpov.’ Game 65 A.Karpov-B.Spassky Candidates Match, Leningrad 1974, 11th game _Queen’s Gambit D58_ 1 d4 Qf6 2 c4 e6 3 «M3 d5 A psychological duel which is typical of matchplay: White has not acceded to his the opponent’s desire to play the Nimzo-Indian Defence, and in reply Black did not want to switch to Queen’s Indian lines. 4 £ic3 i.e7 5 ±g5 h6 6 ±h4 0-0 7 e3 (7 Bel — Game Nos.74 and 84) 7...b6 (it was not hard to expect this popular variation from Spassky, which bears the name of his second, Bondarevsky) 8 jLe2 Korchnoi’s move, though he also employed 8 Bel (Game No. 28). Here Fischer played 8 cxd5 (Volume 4, Game No. 105). 8.. .±b7 9 Jbcf6!? An important part of a plan aimed at re¬ stricting the mobility of the enemy pieces, in particular the bishops, and leaving Black few chances of counterplay. 9.. .±xf6 10 cxd5! exd5 11 0-0 I would have preferred 11 b4, which after 11.. .C5 12 bxc5 bxc5 13 Sbl ±c6 14 0-0 £H7 or ll...c6 12 0-0 ^d7 usually transposes into the variation 11 0-0 £ld7 12 b4. 276 Anatoly the Twelfth 11.. .#d6?! The first questionable moment Numerous games played since then have shown several other plans, involving „x7-c5, to be more promising: 1) 11 ..Mel 12 Wb3\ fid8 13 Sadi.

Later Timman twice — against Yusupov (Rotterdam 1989) and Ivanchuk (Hilversum 1991) — tried to work on Black’s hanging pawns with 16 fld2 %3dl 17 flcl a5 18 Wa3, but he was unable to demonstrate an advantage for White; 2) 11...4kl7. This is also a good continua¬ tion for Black. In Volume 3 (p.326) we have already talked about 12 Wb3 c6 (Timm an - Spassky, Bugojno 1982; Hilversum 1983). An¬ other critical position — 12 b4 c5 13 bxc5 bxc5 14 flbl Jtc6 — occurred seven times© in my matches with Karpov (1984-87) alone, and in Volume 7 we will return to it; 3) ll...c5 (with the two bishops, this imme¬ diate activity is also possible) 12 dxc5, and here there are two ways: 12...Jlxc3 13 bxc3 bxc5 14 flbl Wcl (14...®e7P! is weaker, Kas- parov-Torre, Moscow 1981; after 15 ®a4! %3c6 16 Wa3 Black would have been in diffi¬ culties) 15 ^e5, and White maintains pressure (Kramnik-Khalifinan, Linares 2000), or 12...bxc5!? (this attempt to rehabilitate ll...c5 may prove successful) 13 Wb3 jtc6 14 fladl £kl7!?15£ixd5 flb8 etc. 12 flcl! a6 Black is forced to waste time on this now non-essential move, in order to defend the b5- square. He stands worse after 12,..c6 13 e4! and the belated 12...c5? is completely bad: 13 dxc5 bxc5 14 £>e4! 13 a3 ftd7 Botvinnik remarked that £a position has been reached, similar to a well-known varia¬ tion of the Griinfeld Defence’: 2...g6 3 %3c3 d5 4 £>f3 Agl 5 Jtg5 £te4 6 cxd5 $3xg5 7 £lxg5 e6 8 §3£3 exd5 9 e3 0-0 10 Jte2 c6 11 0-0 ®e7 12 a3 ±e6 13 flcl £>d7 and then 14 £>el ^b6 15 ^d3 flad8 16 ^lc5 1x8 17 b4 £>c4 18 £>bl b6 (18...£M6!P) 19 £>b3 la6 20 Hel flfe8 21 £Md2! b5 22 flal lc8 23 Ifl Wd6 24 ^c5 (Lasker-Botvinnik, Nottingham 1936). In my view, the similarity is rather arbitrary for the moment: White’s pieces and pawns are arranged exactly like Lasker’s, but Black has already weakened his queenside pawn struc¬ ture. Although subsequently, in typical mid- dlegame positions, this similarity may manifest itself. 14 b4 White begins playing for a queenside bind, and Black is obliged to forget about activity with ...c7-c5. But he can try to exploit the 277 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors weakening of the c4-square. 14...55 Botvinnik approves of this committing continuation (he himself played this against Lasker). Tal, by contrast, considers this ‘nervy decision5 to be the initial cause of Black’s diffi¬ culties and he suggests 14..JLe7 15 Jtd3 We6\ 16 Wc2 ±66 and then 17 ±(5 We7 18 e4 dxe4 19 JLxe4 JLxe4 20 <$^xe4 ±{4 21 flcdl Zh{6 with approximate equality. 15 <£>e1?! ‘It is surprising that Karpov also manoeu¬ vres like Lasker. However, in Karpov’s opin¬ ion, 15 2 and ^b3 was stronger, prevent¬ ing ...a6-a5. In this case Black’s position would have been more passive.’ (Botvinnik) 15.. .c6! Tal suggests not blocking the bishop — 15.. .£ib6 16 £id3 £ic4 17 ^c5 Jtc6, but the reinforcement of the b5-pawn also has its point. 16^d3 ^b6?! Only the immediate 16...a5! would have en¬ abled Black to exploit White’s inaccuracy (15 £\el?!) in the implementation of his strategi¬ cally correct plan. The black rook would have been freed from the need to defend the pawn, and after ...a5-a4 and ...4^d7-b6-c4 the a3- pawn could now have become a weakness. 17 a4! (an excellent reply, forcing Black to think constantly about the defence of his a6- pawn) 17..JLd8?! This move, which Tal considered to be the only possibility of obtaining at least some counterplay, was rightly condemned by Bot¬ vinnik and Karpov. The former suggested instead 17...^\c4 18 4k5 Sab8 (when there can follow 19 jtd3 JLd8 20 a5 JLc7 21 g3 Wei 22 Wc2 Jtd6 23 £>e2 Hbe8), and the latter — 17...fiad8 18 4k5 Jtc8 (‘with his rook at d8 and bishop at f6. Black would not have to fear too much the breakthrough in the cen¬ tre’). But best was probably 17...fiae8 18 ^Jc5 1x8 19 flat (19 &g4 Wcl) 19...4M7, Every¬ where White is ‘slightly better’, but for the moment he has nothing real. With the ineffective regrouping made by Spassky, a gradual reduction in Black’s defen¬ sive resources begins, although, as often hap¬ pened in the analysis of games that were of exceptional important for the course of chess history, the evaluation of subsequent events was influenced by the final result. 18 Ac8 19 a5! ±c7 20 g3 £te4 Black has carried out his intention, but the road to equality had not become any easier, especially after the timely opening of the cen¬ tre by the opponent. As for Black’s pride — his knight at c4, it is worth remembering Botvin- nik’s comments on the aforementioned game with Lasker: ‘I realised that the Doctor had deceived me. The knight is beautifully placed at c4, but what next?’ To activate his bishops, Black had to advance his f- and g-pawns, seri¬ ously weakening the defences of his own king. However, Lasker was unable to choose a con- 278 . Anatoly the Twelfth venient moment for the opening of the centre, and the game ended in a draw. 21 e4! ±h3 Tills is possibly the decisive mistake.’ (Tal). This evaluation should more probably have been applied to 17..JLd8, which began a ma¬ noeuvre, the aim of which was in fact to se¬ cure the h3-square for the other bishop. Tal recommends 21...dxe4 22 4i3xe4 Wgti. Then 23 JLxc4 bxc4 24 flxc4 Jth3 25 flel flfe8 would certainly have allowed Black to activate his game, but the cool-headed 23 flel! ^h8 (23...Jth3 is just as hopeless as in the game) 24 4id2! would have retained White’s advantage. 22 flel! Another promising plan for strengthening the position was 22 e5 ®e7 23 flel, but Kar¬ pov is consistent in his intention to open the centre while Black’s forces are poorly coordi¬ nated. 22.. .dxe4 It is not possible for Black to maintain his centre. Botvinxiik thought that 22...flfe8 was more tenacious, but then White could have switched to playing for a bind — 23 e5 ^SSfg6 24 &d3 JLE 25 £le2 ±xd3 26 £)f4, or contin¬ ued his pressure in the centre — 23 JLf3. 23 ^3xe4 %6 The choice for an army, that has lost its co¬ ordination, is limited. The ‘more cautious’ (according to Botvinnik) 23...'ffd8 would not have brought any relief in view of 24 ®b3! (24 ±xc4 bxc4 25 Wc2! is also interesting, with the idea of 25...Wxd4 26 Hcdl ^Bfe5 27 ^xa6l), and Black has no acceptable continua¬ tion: 24...1fxd4 25 g4! f5 26 flcdl! ®e5 27 %3d6\ and wins. 24 ±h5! Karpov continues to strengthen his posi¬ tion, not allowing the opponent even a sem¬ blance of counterplay after 24 Jtxc4 bxc4 25 lfe2 ±f4 26 Sal Sfe8 27 #e4 ^h8. 24.. .#h7 The active 24...HT5, in the hope of chang¬ ing the course of the game in the complica- tions after 25 Ic3! Wd5 26 g4! f5 27 fixh3 £se4 would have resulted in a bad endgame: 28 Ag6 <S3d6 29 Hh5 #a2 (after 29...1rc4 30 Wd2!

By conclusively shutting his strongest piece out of the game, Spassky effectively signs his own death warrant. Fascinating events would have developed in the event of 25...AS 26 £lc3 Sfc8. Now 27 Wxc6 Af4 28 Axf7+ <4h8 is not so clear, but the 27 d5! breakthrough would have provoked tactical complications, leading to a win for White: 27...4ie5 28 Wdl Hd8 29 Wd4 f6 30 £>b7! fldb8 31 dxc6 £>d3 32 ^d5 JLe5 33 4^7+ *h8 34 £M6! ±xd6 35 Wxd6 Sd8 36 WxdS+! flxd8 37 c7 flfB 38 ±gSl ±xg6 39 cSW ±e8 40 £>f5 £kel 41 Axel Wg8 42 *#xa6 Wd5 43 Wd6 etc. Botvinnik and Karpov consider 25...HT5 to be the last chance, for example: 26 ®xf5 (26 flc3 Wd5!) 26..JUS 27 ±£3 flfc8 (27...flfd8? 28 £lc3! flxd4 29 ±xc6 fla7 30 ±xb5!) 28 Jte2! £id6 29 Ad3 ‘with advantage to White’ (Karpov). Indeed, after 29...<?3xe4 30 Jlxe4 Axe4 31 <?3xe4 f5? 32 £ic5 Jtd6 33 fle6 White has a winning position, but 29.. Jth7! still sets some problems. In addition, 31... Jtb8 279 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors is clearly stronger, with saving chances: 32 *g2 (32 d5 £5!) 32...±a7 33 £M6 Id8 34 flxc6 jtxd4 35 Se7 jtc3!, and the outcome is not at all clear.

Therefore after 27 ile2 (or 27 Jtf3 flfc8 28 ite2) it makes sense for Black to think about a pawn sacrifice: 27...flfe8 28 Axc4 bxc4 29 Hxc4 ±d6! 30 £3 h5! 31 *£2 A£8, relying on the saving power of the two bishops. 26 ^c3 g6 27 #xc6! gxh5 28 <£d5!

This game, like the match as whole, showed how completely unfounded was the theory of the ‘clear head’, professed by Spassky and his second. It became very obvious: to achieve consistent successes at high level, it was not enough to have only a general impression about the opening set-ups employed and a handful of ideas. Without extensive and exact knowledge, it is impossible to obtain the de¬ sired middlegame positions, and you have to be satisfied with those into which the oppo¬ nent lures you, by no means the desired ones, so that your ‘clear head’ should have wide scope for creativity. Alas, after this defeat Spassky did not find in himself the strength to readjust to serious, systematic work, and his results began steadily, year by year, to decline. And Karpov became for ever a difficult opponent for him: the overall score of their games with the classical time control was +13—1=20 in favour of the 12th world champion. Karpov: ‘Of all the matches that I have ever played, this was the one where chess itself and improvisation played the greatest role. Many years later Spassky said to me: “I can’t play against you, because I don’t understand your play, I don’t understand the course of your thinking...’’) But to understand and ac¬ knowledge this, it was not enough for him to lose this match; he needed years of reflection, years of observing my play. Fortunately, this match did not spoil our relations. And the subsequent gradual departure from the chess elite of this wonderful fighter is not something that I would put down to me — it was not I who broke him, but Fischer. And how the struggle between us would have gone, if be¬ fore me there had not been Fischer, one can only surmise.’ Here are two more opinions by interested persons — former world champions. Tal: ‘Karpov’s victory over Spassky made a greater impression on me than Korchnoi’s win against Petrosian. I was especially interested in the question of how Karpov would react to his first loss, when he was not accustomed to losing and had no immunity to defeats. But then came the 2nd game, and the 3rd: first a Caro-Kann Defence, and then 1 d4. You know, this is already the response not of a boy, but a man. I remember my 1965 match with Spassky. Somewhere after the 5th game they tried to persuade me: “Give up your 1 e4. Change the tune. Divert him.” But by then I was already “wound up”. But the present-day Karpov, although younger than that Tal, did not become wound up! Karpov’s opening repertoire is trained, like the voice of a very good singer. He is careful with it, and he avoids disclosing it beforehand. Many of his 280 Anatoly the Twelfth opening patterns remind one of Furman’s handling of the opening. Here the young player trusts his mentor absolutely unques- tioningly. And not without reason. Furman has an exceptionally subtle feeling for the opening and he has an enormous understand¬ ing of the game in general.’ Botvinnik: ‘The match with Spassky was a kind of leap into the unknown: previously Karpov had not enjoyed any similar success. When he imposed on his opponent a forceful, uncompromising battle, Spassky suffered four defeats in nine games. After the eleventh game the score was 7-4 — the same, as in the match in Reykjavik, Karpov played brilliantly. It is hard to say where he displayed the greater mastery — in attack or defence. The calculation of variations was combined with skilful posi¬ tional play. Karpov realised that he could sur¬ pass Spassky only if he gave everything to chess... This match clarified the situation at the chess summit At least, for those who wanted to recognise this.’ Yes, this was a truly historic match - the in¬ tersection of two bright stars: one rising, and the other slowly setting, as at one time in the match between Keres and Euwe (cf. Volume 2). This was, in effect, Spassky’s last real chance of fighting for the return of his world tide! Three years later his final Candidates match with Korchnoi looked more like the agony of a great player (cf. the chapter ‘Belgrade Re¬ venge5), whereas against Karpov, especially at the start, Spassky was still full of strength and ambition, almost as in his best years. Incidentally, I am surprised that so many experts predicted a win for Spassky. Appar¬ ently, at that time they did not yet pay suffi¬ cient attention to ratings — objective indicators of a player’s strength. This is how the quartet of candidates looked on 1 July 1973: Karpov — 2660, Spassky — 2655, Korchnoi — 2650, Pet¬ rosian — 2640. That is, one can talk about an approximate equality of strength. Then Spassky gained points in the USSR Champi¬ onship and his match with Byrne, as did Kar¬ pov in the Madrid tournament and his match with Polugayevsky. The FIDE ratings were next published on 1 May 1974, now taking account of the Candidates semi-final matches: Karpov — 2700(1), Korchnoi — 2670, Spassky — 2650, Petrosian — 2640. These are not empty figures. Over a period of many years Karpov achieved consistently good results, and above all he demonstrated a consistently high standard of play. And he achieved his first creative peak in the encoun¬ ter with Spassky. It was from this match, and not from April 1975, that the Anatoly Karpov era begins. Coronation So, there only remained the final match with Korchnoi. When I was asked how I rated my chances, I invariably replied: the play will show, but I myself was already thinking about Fischer. And no one heard me saying that this was not my cycle any more,’ remembers Kar¬ pov. Botvinnik also believed in him: Don’t worry/ he replied to the questions of chess fans, ‘Karpov didn’t win against Polugayevsky and Spassky, in order to lose to Korchnoi.’ But first, a month after the Candidates semi-final matches, there was the World Olympiad (Nice, June 1974), timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of FIDE. The or¬ ganisers created excellent playing conditions, hoping that the ‘Tournament of Nations’ would become Fischer’s first appearance in his capacity as world champion. The intrigue was stirred up by the fact that for the first time the USSR team would be led by Karpov — the new contender for the crown, who was dreaming of doing battle with the champion. Their clash was awaited with enormous inter¬ est But, alas, Fischer did not arrive... The splendid Soviet six — Karpov, Korchnoi, Spassky, Petrosian, reserves Tal and Kuzmin — went through the entire Olympiad without a single defeat and achieved one of the best results in history: 1. USSR — 46 out of 60; 2. Yugoslavia - 37V4; 3. USA - 36V&, etc. 281 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Karpov played especially well. Like Tal in his time, in just two years he had risen from one of the reserves to board one. After five successive wins in the preliminary group, he added a sixth at the start of the final tourna¬ ment — against Hort, and then, after a drawing respite, he also made short work of Unzicker.

After 13...^a5 14 b3! the knight has only the b7-square.

A typical modem procedure in such posi¬ tions. White does not give up his offensive on the kingside, but, by opening a second front, he wants to create more favourable conditions for it. However, if the opponent makes a poor response, he can also achieve much on the queenside, by exploiting the a-file and the weakness of the b5-pawn (cf. the note to Black’s 16th move). After the straightforward 16 £ifl the great Akiba demonstrated a plan of defence back in the early 20th century, which immediately be- 282 Anatoly the Twelfth came standard: 16...£)e8 17 g4 g6 18 thgl 19 &hl f6 20 Igl £>f7 21 ±e3 Ad7 22 ®e2 Ia8 (22...£3g5!P) 23 4M2 4>h8 24 b3 Wbl 25 id3 Sa6!

Black choose an incorrect set-up of his heavy pieces and because of this he loses the battle for the a-file. The correct way was pointed out by Karpov himself: 19...2fb8 20 Jld3 Wc8!, after which Black exchanges one pair of rooks and increases his chances of a successful defence. 20 JLd3 g6 21 <£ig3 jk,f8 (fighting for the a- file would have lost a pawn: 21...Wd8? 22 fixa8 flxa8 23 bxc5 £ixc5 24 Axc5 dxc5 25 £ixe5) 22 2a2! c4 The invasion of the queen after 22...fixa2 23 ®xa2 cxb4 24 cxb4 Wc3 would merely have uncovered another weakness in Black’s position - the b5-pawn: 25 ttbl #a3 26 Scl fixcl+ 27 ±xcl #a4 28 ±e3 29 £>e2. 23 ±b1 The aim of this move, preventing the rapid concentration of white pieces on the a-file, is nothing to do with overprotecting the e4- pawn. Karpov does not want to allow his op- 253 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ponent the slightest counter-chances, and so he radically prevents ...f7-f5. 23...#d8 ‘Also after 23...4M8 24 fle2 there would have been no contest for the a-file. In addi¬ tion, Black would also have had to reckon with 24 Sxa8 Hxa8 25 Ah6.’ (Karpov) 24 Aa7! This original manoeuvre became a well- known technique in the fight for the open file after the 10th game of the Spassky-Karpov match (Game No. 64). There Karpov managed to defend himself, and now he himself tests its effectiveness. White temporarily blocks the a- file, concentrating his heavy pieces on it under cover of the bishop, and at a convenient mo¬ ment, after retreating the bishop, he invades the opponent's position. Largely because of the bad position of his knight at b7, it is hard to Black to counter this obvious intention. Incidentally, in a similar situation (true, in another classical opening — the Queen’s Gam¬ bit) I employed the manoeuvre Ad3-h7 to seize control of the h-file (Kasparov-Karpov, 21st matchgame, Moscow 1985). 24...£le8 25 Ac2 <5ic7 26 Seal We7 27 Abl Ae8 ‘Black has done his best to prepare for play on the queenside, by linking his forces.

And indeed, it is a das sic example of how to play positions with a dosed centre. When after the game Umdcker in Russian suddenly cursed his position “with this idiotic black knight, which simply cannot leap out of its cage,” I nearly fell off my chair in surprise,’ related Anatoly. Meanwhile, Tal already re¬ marked here that playing to restrict the mobil¬ ity of an enemy knight was one of Karpov’s favourite strategic methods. After gaining a further three wins with White he achieved the best result on board one (+10=4) without any visible tension. Kar¬ pov did not play in the last two rounds, since as a contender for the crown he was taking part in the work of the FIDE Congress, which had to approve the regulations for the world championship match the following year. The other contender, Korchnoi, replaced his young colleague on board one, after asking him to speak at the Congress on behalf of them both. Karpov: *We agreed to fight to the bitter end against three of Fischer’s demands: 1) an unlimited match; 2) to ten wins; 3) with a 9-9 score, victory would be awarded to the world champion. However, after our match, which he lost, Korchnoi began saying that Fischer’s demands were justified, and that they should have been accepted. I think that this was not very nice on his part.’ Why did Korchnoi change his position? He spoke out publicly on this vexed question in an interview on the eve of the historic 32nd game of the match in Baguio (1978) and then in his book Antichess'. "With the score at 5-5, after three months of intensive struggle, I took a quite different view on the haggling that preceded the passing of the chess crown from Fischer to Karpov... Had not Fischer been right, when he de¬ manded that the world champion should de¬ fend his tide with a two-point advantage — that the challenger should win by a score of 10-8, but that with a score of 9-9 the champion would retain his tide? Yes, now I realised that this was quite natural: the world champion deserves it, to say nothing of the fact that, with the scores level, further play to the first win is a pure lottery, and whoever wins, it is no longer convincing!’ But in the summer of 1974 the two ‘Ks’ were still presenting a united front, expressing the Soviet point of view. The atmosphere at the Congress was extremely heated — after ultimatums sent by the world champion by telegram the question was basically this: ‘Ei¬ ther FIDE or Fischer.’ Therefore Karpov’s speech provoked a mixed reaction. Roshal: ‘Some of the delegates interrupted him, and the chairman did not support him, but, on the contrary, remarked that he was repeating what had been said earlier. Karpov blushed angrily, was silent for almost a minute, and then quite calmly added: 1 consider these remarks to be disrespectful.’ And he stepped down into the hall, where he was applauded by some of those who only just before had been prevent¬ ing him from speaking.’ As a result of the work of two congresses — this and the extraordinary one (March 1975) — all Fischer’s demands were met, apart from one: that with a 9-9 score the champion would retain his title (more details about these events are given in Volume 4). His famous ‘I resign my FIDE world chess champion tide’ declara¬ tion- was sent by Bobby to Nice, which pro¬ voked a rhetorical question by Najdorf: Why, if Fischer is giving up his tide, is the final Candidates match not being held under world championship match regulations?’ The Karpov-Korchnoi match (Moscow, au¬ tumn 1974), which effectively became a clash for the wodd championship, was played to five wins by one of the participants, but with a limit of 24 games — fully comparable with the regula¬ tions of previous matches for the crown. What were the pre-match forecasts? During the Olympiad in Nice, Tim man mentioned that, as before, Korchnoi still gets 285 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors into time-trouble. Karpov, by contrast, plays easily, with a big reserve on his clock, and this, in Jan’s opinion, gives him an advantage in the match. Andersson and Portisch considered the two players’ chances to be roughly equal. Najdorf gave preference to Karpov, while Hort, drawing attention to Karpov’s consis¬ tently good form, at the same time suggested that Korchnoi had been husbanding his strength somewhat in Nice, and that the final match would become a “war of nerves”. So¬ viet grandmasters were usually cautious in their predictions. Polugayevsky mentioned that on Karpov’s side were his age, consis¬ tency of results, and constant and steady pro¬ gress (“He played much more strongly against Spassky than against me”). Taimanov spoke about the fact that Korchnoi sometimes “ex¬ poses himself’ too much, and about the stability of Karpov’s play and his growing strength: “In my opinion, sooner or later he will be world champion”. To a certain extent this pronouncement was similar to the opin¬ ion of Larsen — in chess style he was closer to Korchnoi, but the voice of reason suggested: Karpov.’ (Roshal) Not long before the match, Karpov’s train¬ ing staff received a powerful reinforcement Furman and Razuvaev were joined by Efim Geller — a player of encyclopaedic knowledge and brilliant attacking style. According to Ra- zuvaev, somewhere towards the finish of the match Geller expressed his dissatisfaction with Karpov’s play to Furman and angrily repeated: Tolya must be re-taught: he should play more aggressively!’ Furman listened for a long time to his colleague, silently smoking a cigarette, and then said: ‘Do you know what, Fima? If you don’t like it, find yourself another lad and teach him to play how you think he should. But I am satisfied about everything in Tolya and I like the way he plays!’ An eloquent little scene: it is well known that Furman related to Karpov with paternal tenderness. However, Geller had no grounds for criti¬ cism at the start of the match. After a fighting draw in the 1st game, Karpov gained a bril¬ liant combinative win in the 2nd, employing one of the deep preparations of Efim Pet¬ rovich.

The prelude to an interesting novelty. 17 e5! and 18 g5 is threatened, but the following comment by Karpov shows that even in the analysis of sharp positions he endeavoured to rely on reasoning of a general nature: "An attempt to support this move with varia¬ tions was made by E.Chumak, a player from Dnepropetrovsk, who published an article on this topic in 1972. The logical basis for the re¬ treat of the knight from the centre is roughly as follows. The c3-point is a very important one in the arrangement of the white pieces, against which Black concentrates his threats. Here a typical exchange sacrifice (.. JSxc3) often occurs, when the opponent gains a strong attack (it is noteworthy that after the doubling of the white pawns on the c-file, Blacks position is so rich in possibilities that also without an attack, even in the endgame, he can maintain the balance — this was splendidly demonstrated in his games by the outstanding grandmaster Leonid Stein). Thus the main idea of 16 4tkle2 is to support the c3-point In addition, from e2 the knight can easily be switched for a direct attack on the enemy king/ Apart from the prophylactic move in the game, White has a wide choice of attacking plans. Here are a few illustrations, arranged more or less in chronological order: 1) 16 e5 <53xg4 (or 16...dxe5 17 <£}b3 Sc6! 18 tth2 flxc3! 19 bxc3 Wc8! with counter¬ play) 17 fxg4 itxg4 18 fidgl dxe5 19 flxg4 h5! 20 fixh5 Bxd4! 21 Jtxd4 exd4 22 <5)e4 (or 22 £ki5) 22...gxh5 23 flxg7+ 4>xg7 24 %5+ <4>h7 25 lfxh5+ 4>g7 V2-V2 (Chumak- Okhotnik, Dnepropetrovsk 1970); 2) 16 Jk,h6 <5lxe4 17 Hfe3 Bxc3 18 bxc3 ^f6 19 £xg7 (4)xg7 20 Sh2 (or 20 Sh4 Sg8 Tsesh- kovsky-Miles, Wijk aan Zee 1989) 20...fih8 (20...Wc7 has also been played, but not 20JHra5?I 21 £)b3 lrxa2 22 Wxe7 ®a3+ 23 sfebl Se8 24 Wxd6 ttxd6 25 fixd6 with advan¬ tage to White, as in the source game Geller- Korchnoi, 4th matchgame, Moscow 1971) 21 £>b3 Jx6 22 g5 <5/h5 23 f4 Ie8 24 fi Wb6 25 4M4 Hfc5!

On the whole, practice has shown that Black has adequate defensive resources in all these variations. 16.. /§a5 To judge by the speed with which the two players made their moves (thereby emphasising the depth of their home preparation), this queen sortie was part of an aggressive defensive plan thought up beforehand, involving, as shown by the game, a certain risk Korchnoi is 287 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ready to exchange his bishop at g7 for the sake of rapidly intensifying his attacking potential. Now, summing up the results of the analy¬ ses, it can be concluded that Black was wrong not to play 16...fle8!, enabling him to avoid the exchange of his g7-bishop, which cements together his king’s defences. After the sharp prelude 17 Jlh6 JLh8 18 e5 5ixg4! 19 fxg4 the play can proceed in two ways: 1) 19...ilxg4 20 exd6 Wxd6 21 ttxd6 exd6 22 flxd6 (Beliavsky-Filguth, Caracas 1976), and despite White’s material advantage, the position is unclear after 22..

But here this is inef¬ fective, since there are no targets in White’s position that can be attacked. Botvinnik judged this position to be theoretically won, but I would add that Black nevertheless re¬ tains possibilities of continuing the fight. 18#xh6 2fc8 19 2d3 ‘Up till this point both players had been moving almost instandy, but here Korchnoi thought for a long time. And indeed, he had something to think about... The novelty 19 Bd3!, overprotecting the c3-point, in a num¬ ber of variations simultaneously frees the knight at e2 for the attack’ (Karpov) At the start of a match Korchnoi used to employ a risky strategy, based on the one-off employment of rare openings in his repertoire. This was apparendy how he conceived the idea of playing the T)ragon’, which at that time had the reputation of being a compli¬ cated variation, with numerous positions lack¬ ing a clear evaluation. During the three previ¬ ous years he had employed it in only three games, but what games! Twice in his Candi¬ dates match with Geller (1971) and a month before that in the 5th game of a training match with... Karpov. Therefore the appearance of the T)ragon’ was predictable, and Karpov’s powerful team had prepared their protege well, in addition developing a new plan for White. To all ap¬ pearances, Korchnoi’s preparation for the duel with his young opponent was not so thorough and deep. £ Meanwhile, analysis shows that 19 Sd5, which before this game was considered the main move, is no less effective than Karpov’s novelty, the main virtues of which are its un¬ expectedness and the enhanced solidity of the white king’s shelter. Analysis diagram 288 Anatoly the Twelfth Botvinnik writes that Black had a choice between a slighdy inferior endgame after lSL.WdS and the complications following 19.. .54.5?, ‘which, apparently, were what Korchnoi had in mind/ However, there are no ‘complications' after the obvious 20 g5 4ih5 21 4if4.

The first independent move — and immedi¬ ately a decisive mistake. After thinking for more than half an hour in an unfamiliar and undoubtedly critical situation, out of four pos¬ sibilities Korchnoi chose the one that led most quickly and by force... to a loss! Karpov agrees with Botvinnik, that the best practical chance was 19...Wd8. ‘Black has nothing worse to fear than a slightly inferior endgame.' (Botvinnik). He obviously had in mind 20 g5 £ih5 21 £if4 lff8 22 £>xh5 lfxh6 23 gxh6 gxh5. The argument about the virtues of this endgame ceased to be topical after Shamkovich published a new idea — 20 4id5!

Black loses the exchange, gaining two pawns in return — which would be quite sufficient, except that the initiative remains with White. Let us examine the consequences of 19...fl8c5, which before the match Karpov and his trainers considered to be best.

J Then, after three draws, Karpov also won the 6th game: on this occasion Korchnoi an¬ swered with the exotic for him l...e5 2 £}f3 £)f6 and quickly ended up in a difficult posi¬ tion. After this he finally switched to the well- tested French Defence and did not lose again with Black, displaying remarkable willpower and tenacity. Beginning with the 7th game, there followed a series of nine successive draws! In the 13th, the most exciting and hard-fought, Karpov played recklessly for a win in a time scramble and was nearly made to pay for it. After missing a win on the 34th move, during the resumption Korchnoi tried for a long time to make something of his re¬ maining advantage, and created a dangerous passed a-pawn, but Karpov defended ’ excel¬ lently and gained a draw on the 97th move. ** In the opening of the 17th game (a Catalan) Korchnoi gained an obvious advantage, but he delayed somewhere and in search of ways to strengthen his position he ended up in severe time-trouble. On the 30th move he made a crude oversight, lost material, and was forced to resign immediately after the time control. The score became 3-0 in Karpov’s favour, or, counting by the old regulations, 10-7. And Anatoly decided that the matter was settled: 'After this the match should have fin¬ ished somewhere around the 20th game... Why didn’t this happen? It was all because of the "seditious” thought: the match is decided, so why are any additional efforts needed; all I have to do is turn up and sign the score-sheets of the last few games...’ But years later he ad¬ mitted: T decided that it was time to remem¬ ber about Fischer, that for the batde with him 290 Anatoly the Twelfth I had to preserve both strength, and ideas. Confidence developed into assurance: I al¬ ready felt that I was the winner.’ The result of this premature relaxation was two losses — in the 19th and 21st games, which sharply aggravated the match situation. Before this Karpov had never suffered more than two defeats in any competition — what would happen now? Precisely during those days I was passing through Moscow — returning home from a session of the Botvinnik School. I remember how Mikhail Moiseevich commented on the games from the match, appearing at the Scien¬ tists’ Club in Dubna (before that, at the Feb¬ ruary session, he had covered the Karpov- Polugayevsky match in the same way, and all these commentaries formed the basis of his future book Anatoly Karpov: His Road to the World Championship). And I was fortunate enough to see the 21st game live: I was taken to it by my trainer Alexander Nikitin. For the first time in my life I experienced the amazing match atmosphere — the rever¬ ential silence'in the auditorium, occasionally broken by rumbles of admiration or disap¬ pointment, and the seething of the press cen¬ tre, where Nikitin took me ‘to observe the thinking of the titans’. Then he took me into the auditorium and left. Glancing at the enormous demonstration board, I was stupe¬ fied. With the aid of a long pole, the demonstra¬ tor had just reproduced Karpov’s move 12.. .flb8? on the board. What on earth?! I don’t understand: White has the winning stroke 13 ^xh7! While Korchnoi was thinking over his reply, Nikitin came back. I whispered to him: 'Knight h7!’ And he merely replied: ‘Yes...’ Obviously others had also noticed this move: the audience became noticeably ani¬ mated. Indeed, after 13 £ixh71 2e8 (alas, 13.. .<4)xh7 14 Wh6+ 4?g8 15 Wxg6+ leads to unavoidable mate) 14 #h6 15 S^g5 ±xg5 16 jbtg5 #xg5 17 #xg5 ±xd5 18 0-0 jtxc4 19 f4 Black resigned. It was a pity, of course, that the game concluded so quickly and I did not see a genuine battle... Even so, this was my first encounter with big-time chess, and as an 11-year-old boy, it left an in¬ delible impression on me. It need hardly be said how anxious the So¬ viet sports officials became, having pinned their hopes on Karpov, when three games before the finish the match score became 3-2. According to an eye-witness, immediately after the catastrophic 21st game Baturinsky, the h^ad of the chess section of the USSR Sports Committee, went up to Anatoly and suggested that he should urgently discuss the situation in the event of a drawn match, but Karpov forcefully replied: ‘I am leading and I do not intend to draw the match!’ I should remind you that, according to the regulations, in the event of a drawn match everything would be decided by a drawing of lots. And, as has al¬ ready been mentioned in Volume 2, the Sports Committee officials tried at that time to per¬ suade the FIDE President Euwe, who had arrived in Moscow, to change the regulations... Fortunately for chess, Euwe stood his ground. Karpov also stood his ground, making three draws, although it was not easy for him to endure such an absurd and brutal rout It transpires that earlier, after the 5th game, in which the same opening variation occurred, Petrosian had advised him not to play it any more, but Anatoly had forgotten his advice... 291 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ‘One has to give Petrosian his due: his sense of danger was phenomenal.’ The 23rd game, his last with Black, pre¬ sented a particular difficulty: how to gain a draw? Here Botvinnik gave him some good advice, reminding him of a variation of the Queen’s Indian Defence from the 21st game of the Euwe-Alekhine return match (1937). If Alekhine played this, it means that it’s not bad,’ said Botvinnik. And indeed, Karpov confidently gained a draw. And the concluding, 24th game resembled the last, 30th game of the Alekhine-Euwe match (1935). In a difficult position, a pawn down, realising that he had no chances of suc¬ cess, Korchnoi (following Alekhine’s example) offered a draw. And Karpov immediately ac¬ cepted, since this signified his victory in the match: 3-2 with 19 draws, or I2V2-IIV2 under the old system. 1 think that I should have won this match by a bigger margin,’ the winner stated. ‘Be¬ cause I myself know that at some point I re¬ laxed, at some point I played worse than I could have done.’ And the loser, despite a provocative interview, which had serious con¬ sequences for him (cf. p.79), admitted: 1 felt extremely tired, so that in the last three games I was unable to give my opponent a genuine fight.’ A few months later it transpired that effec¬ tively this had been a match for the world championship. But the paradox of the 1974 cycle is that, in the creative sense, the function of a match for the world championship was fulfilled by the semi-final encounter between Karpov and Spassky, which had an enormous influence on the further development of chess. It is for this reason that I have given an almost complete commentary on it, whereas from the final match I have given only one game, the most vivid — although, as Petrosian said, ‘such a game can serve as the creative rehabilitation of an entire match.’ But the splendid pinnacle of the Karpov-Korchnoi confrontation was to be the match in Baguio four years later... Spassky: This was Anatoly Karpov’s cycle. All his matches — against Polugayevsky, against me, and against Korchnoi — he won well. At the given moment Karpov is objec¬ tively without doubt the strongest player. In its duration the final Candidates match was equivalent to previous matches for the world championship. Karpov’s play was, so to speak, technically powerful; he did not fully disclose his creative potential. Such a strategic plan appears to me to have been the correct one. It has to be borne in mind that it was Karpov who was the first to endure the increased strain of the new regulations for selecting the challenger.’ Tal: In the cycle of Candidates matches the future winner performed as though in three roles: with Polugayevsky this was, despite his youth, a mature psychologist, capable of sub¬ tly exploiting the human weaknesses in his opponent’s character; with Spassky — a genu- %inely inspired player, equally formidable in attack and tenacious in defence; with Korchnoi — not a boy, but a man, atle to en¬ dure an encounter unparalleled in its competi¬ tive intensity. Karpov is all the time progress¬ ing and is still far from his peak. I have no doubt that by the time of his match with Fischer he will be even stronger.’ ‘In the final the battle was different in char* acter to the match with Spassky. On this occa¬ sion Karpov played more prudently, avoiding risk as far as possible. He already sensed his strength, and he had to win the match, and that was all!’ wrote Botvinnik in April 1975, and he pointed out the 23-year-old grandmas¬ ter’s three vulnerable points, on the elimina¬ tion of which he still had to work: inadequate physical condition, non-indifference to praise (it was supposedly because of this that after his third win he ‘lost his respect for his oppo¬ nent and his sense of danger — and the strong¬ est feature of Karpov’s competitive strength disappeared5), and comparatively modest opening arsenal. But he concludes his diagno- 292 Anatoly the Twelfth sis with these words: ‘Anatoly Karpov is un¬ doubtedly the strongest chess fighter of our time.’ Euwe: The final Candidates match was a difficult, exhausting struggle, and was interest¬ ing in the sense of being a psychological duel between two very evenly-matched opponents/ At the closing of the match the FIDE Presi¬ dent was asked what would happen if Fischer did not accept the challenger’s challenge by the expiry of the established date. Euwe re- - plied: Tfi by 1 April 1975 Fischer does not in¬ form me that he is accepting the challenge, I will fly to Moscow to proclaim Karpov the 12th world champion/ But there was still some possibility that the match with Fischer would take place, and the USSR Sports Committee did everything pos¬ sible to ensure that Karpov prepared thor¬ oughly. Early in 1975 several training sessions were held with the participation of the coun¬ try’s best chess experts. Of considerable inter¬ est are the memoirs of an eye-witness to these events, Yuri Razuvaev, which are published here for the first time: ‘A year earlier, before his match with Po- lugayevsky, Anatoly was lazy about working — he preferred to mess about with stamps, play cards and billiards, or pass the time playing blitz (here he was fearfully strong: he would crush everyone in turn, even Tal). Apparently he had not yet got used to the cycle. He was a genuine natural talent: in his childhood he studied Capablanca’s games — and he began playing. He was a purely practical player, a competitor! Well, of course, then Furman did a great deal for him... But when Anatoly started working, he worked very well: he ac¬ tively participated in the analysis and made a mass of discoveries. Moreover, it was always important for him that someone was “play¬ ing” against him. Once every hour or so he would change colour, and “play” the same position with both White and with Black: he was as though training his playing skills. It was essential for him constantly to feel resistance — then he would be turned on and find the “guiding thread”. I was staggered at how “omnivorous” he was: he would play all the standard positions equally well with both col¬ ours. Apparently it was here that his unique feeling for position was displayed. I have seen many world champions, but this was unusual. ‘Of course, Geller’s influence cannot be discounted, but another player who had a great influence on Karpov was Tal. For some reason it is customary to say of Tal only that “he calculated variations like a computer”, and few mention his unique understanding of chess, his ability instantly to evaluate a posi¬ tion. Such depth is something that I have not seen in anyone! Of course, Geller was a fan¬ tastically deep player, but Tal had a more sub¬ tle feeling for position. He played modem, ultra-dynamic chess. Thanks to his evaluating ability he would very quickly grasp the essence of the problem and decide on the direction of work in-any highly complicated position. In this sense he was completely unique! True, in his searchings Tal was rather lazy and he would usually suggest: “We’d do better to play his position in a blitz game!” ‘At a training session in a sanatorium on the outskirts of Leningrad there were three of us: Tal, Karpov and I. And when they sat down to “play a position” at blitz, Tal would begin literally to gush forth with ideas. And I in as¬ tonishment would sit alongside and record them in a thick notebook... ‘How did the preparations go for the battle with Fischer? Firstly, since there was a lengthy match in prospect, Karpov needed a very wide choice of openings: after all, over such a dis¬ tance they would sooner or later be “breached”. Therefore against 1 e4 we pre¬ pared, apart from l...e5 and l...c6, the Sicilian Defence — the Paulsen Variation and the Scheveningen. At that time in the Caro-Kann Anatoly preferred 4...Jtf5, which was success¬ fully tried in the match with Spassky. I was about to suggest “my” move 4...^d7, but Tolya sceptically replied: Well, only as a last 293 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors resort.” It is amusing that years later this varia¬ tion became Karpov’s main weapon for Black! ‘Secondly, we shared Getter's opinion that Fischer played the opening very riskily, em¬ ploying very sharp and sometimes strategically dubious variations. Therefore, strangely enough, the opening was his weakest, most vulnerable point. Not without reason did Lasker say: t£In chess Black must first of all defend, otherwise the game turns into a farce.” Since in double-edged variations the role of any preparation increases many-fold: here the outcome of a game can be decided literally by one move. And we endeavoured to devise as many such preparations as possible — underwater mines, especially for White. ‘Thus, against the Najdorf Variation in the Sicilian Defence a deep study was made of the variations with 6 Jlg5 — both before the match with Polugayevsky and later, a weighty contribution was made by Geller and Tal. Against the Alekhine Defence, which Fischer played in his match with Spassky, Anatoly was armed “to the teeth” even earlier. When, at the finish of the Interzonal tournament, Korchnoi suggested to him that they should both agree draws, he was indignant: no way, “my” Torre plays the Alekhine Defence — this is a ready-made point!... ‘In addition, before his match with Spassky I convinced Anatoly that he should “serve from both sides”, and this produced an excel¬ lent effect. After all, in Reykjavik Fischer too had successfully played many openings (al¬ though here I agree with Bondarevsky — out of fear!). Why not operate in the same way against Fischer himself? I remember Furman complaining to me: “Some ‘patzer’ taught Tolya to play 1 e4, and now you and I are suf¬ fering as a result!” Furman and I played 1 d4, and for Karpov too this move was fully in keeping with his style. In short, we continued working on 1 d4. From Fischer one could mainly expect the King’s Indian Defence, the Griinfeld and the Modem Benoni — very thorough preparations were made for these openings, and even training games were played. When it transpired that Fischer was not going to play, Furman shrugged his shoulders: ‘All these openings fof Black are no good — and he decided to give up.’ Indeed, soon doubts were cast on much of Fischer’s reper¬ toire. It is a pity that this happened not in a direct encounter, which could have given a gigantic impetus to the development of open¬ ing theory. We thought that in such matches one should try and breach the opponent’s defences in the main variations, by choosing the most critical lines. And this course, inci¬ dentally, prevailed in subsequent matches for the world championship, and later it was also taken up by Kasparov. ‘This great amount of work helped Tolya subsequently: he began winning all the' tour¬ naments! As they say, the shell missed its tar¬ get. But for Karpov’s chess development it was bad that he did not play the match with Fischer. It was the misfortune of the great player: he quickly realised that, to defeat the rest, he did not need anything more — and he practically stopped working. In Baguio he largely relied on his old knowledge. And as a result, after losing his best years, he did not fully realise his creative potential. Fischer real¬ ised his completely, but Karpov nevertheless fell short.’ Bondarevsky could not come to these ses¬ sions, but he and Polugayevsky presented Karpov with detailed written descriptions of the American champion (these interesting studies were recently published in the book Russians versus Fischer). The reminiscences of Igor Zaitsev, published here for the first time, are also very interesting ‘At the very start of April 1975 I was sud¬ denly (most probably, through the approach of Tigran Petrosian) invited to Novogorsk to a training session with Anatoly Karpov, for consultation on certain theoretical questions. Here, as I imagined, the preparations for the match with Fischer should have been at fever 294 Anatoly the Twelfth pitch. But it was very much a holiday atmos¬ phere that reigned at the training session. Karpov and Petrosian were keenly contesting a game of billiards, and Furman, bantering with them in turn, was phlegmatically watch¬ ing the game. Within some forty minutes the battle on the green baize concluded and we went off for a substantial dinner. This training scenario was one that I was already well famil¬ iar with, from my long years of association with Petrosian. Both Karpov and Petrosian always preferred live chess contact to exhaust¬ ing analysis. Roughly an hour and a half after dinner Anatoly and I finally went off to his room and sat down at a chessboard. Well, what could I show him in a hurry about the genius Fischer? I remember that I tried to interest him in a new defence, which at the end of the 1960s I had devised in the Spanish Exchange Variation: 1 e4 e5 2 £ic6 3 ±b5 a6 4 i.xc6 dxc6 5 0-0 £}e7!? (af¬ ter my publications in 64 it was successfully employed by Keres), but since in the main line 6 4ke5 Wd4 7 #h5 g6 8 %5 kg 9 £>d3 Black had to go in for unclear play a pawn down by 9...f5, it did not arouse any particular enthusiasm in Karpov. Some other interesting ideas, relating to the Spanish Open Variation, were received more favourably by him. How¬ ever, he also did not want to devote much attention to them: after all, the probability that Fischer would suddenly prefer a specific varia¬ tion of the Ruy Lopez to the Sicilian was ri¬ diculously small. And Karpov, who by nature was purposeful and very organised, never wasted his time. ‘During out first chess rendezvous he was constantly being called to the only telephone, which was on the ground floor of the build¬ ing: it was at this time that the situation re¬ garding the world championship was finally being settled — Fischer had not accepted the challenge. And it so happened that my theo¬ retical reviews began with the challenger, and effectively concluded with the world cham¬ pion. It is hard to say who would have won their match. I have heard several times from Kar¬ pov himself that in that year Fischer’s chances were slightly better. But before the start of the Candidates matches Karpov had modestly said: “This is not my cycle.” It seem^ to me that a new qualitative leap could well have been expected of him. Tn all his triumphal matches, from virtually the very first games Fischer was able, in some inexplicable way, to sow doubts in the hearts of his experienced opponents and gaifi a psychological advantage over them. Where the opponent was less compliant, like, for exam¬ ple, the uncompromising Reshevsky, the battle was far tougher. In the first half of his match with Fischer, Petrosian also looked like a wor- thy opponent. But as soon as Petrosian cracked and he lost his mental balance, Fischer became transformed and began play¬ ing with redoubled energy. As some profes¬ sional psychologists assert, in an encounter between two individuals the aggregate meas¬ ure of confidence is a constant: that which one loses is gained by the other. ‘It is extremely improbable that such a psy¬ chological weakening could have occurred with Karpov. This is confirmed by the whole of his exceptionally stable career. True, that same career suggests that Fischer could have proved more durable, if the match had been excessively prolonged. Karpov would have had to pay very serious attention to his overall physical preparation. We must not forget that he was eight years younger than the champion and, according to the statistics of world championship matches, overall success is nev¬ ertheless on the side of the young. ‘Comparing their chess virtues is even more difficult. In my opinion, by 1975 Karpov’s positional intuition was stronger, but Fischer’s combinative vision was wider in scope. Kar¬ pov was more tenacious in defence — Fischer was more resolute in attack. There was also a slight difference in how they converted an advantage: there, where Karpov acted more 295 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors methodically, Fischer would achieve his aim more energetically. ‘Fischer would probably have had a more detailed impression of “his” set-ups, but since his opening repertoire was rather narrow, Karpov could have probed for vulnerable places in it, also by relying on the united sup¬ port of the “home producers” of theory. To a narrow circle of acquaintances Petrosian said several times that the only reason why Fischer left chess was because almost all of his open¬ ing variations had already been refuted. This is possibly an exaggeration, but many weak points in Fischer’s favourite lines were indeed already well marked. ‘I will try to guess the specific nature of their opening confrontation. Fischer would have been unlikely to deviate from his cus¬ tomary 1 e4, since he would have seen that in the closed games Karpov adopted exception¬ ally solid and reliable set-ups. But how would Karpov have repelled 1 e4 ? Probably in an uncomfortably diverse way for his opponent, relying simultaneously on the Ruy Lopez, Pet- roff, Caro-Kann and even Sicilian. Karpov could handle the Ruy Lopez both traditionally, and by selecting one of the specific variations. He could have been helped by the fact that at that time, in order to avoid either the Marshall Attack or the Open Variation, Fischer' often replied to 3...a6 with 4 Jtxc6. ‘With White, in contrast to his opponent, Karpov could have alternated between 1 e4 and 1 d4 far more freely. 1 e4 would have usually led to variations of the Sicilian, while after 1 d4 Fischer could have been mainly ex¬ pected to choose the King’s Indian Defence. It would appear that over a long match Kar¬ pov’s chances in the opening would have been, at the least, not worse. ‘In the transition stage from opening to middlegame, in the solving of strategic prob¬ lems I would give some preference to Fischer at that time, bearing in mind his greater knowledge and experience. However, I do not see on which scales it is possible to measure and compare such dissimilar factors, that Kar¬ pov was a young, rapidly developing and highly trained player, while Fischer, practising a strict self-denial tournament diet and con¬ cocting opening variations alone, was an ex¬ ceptionally deep and subtle researcher. ‘At any event, for me it is evident that they were opponents who were worthy of each other. Both of them hardly ever made serious mistakes, they lost extremely rarely and in the eyes of their contemporaries they appeared to be almost infallible players.’ In the previous volume I have already ex¬ pressed my opinion about why Fischer re¬ fused to play Karpov. Now, when in general terms we are familiar with the work of the Karpov team, I should like to explain more clearly my vision of the situation that had arisen by that time in world chess. In my view, when Furman and Petrosian explained Fischer’s withdrawal by the fact that nearly all of his opening variations were al¬ ready ‘no good’ or had been ‘refuted’, this was an obvious exaggeration — the maximalism typical of chess experts of the old school, ac¬ customed to thinking in general categories. True, they hit on the correct explanation, but they expressed their idea inaccurately. It is hard to understand: which variations, strictly speaking, had been refuted? The very sharp ‘Najdorf is still holding out to this day, as are Fischer’s defences to 1 d4. And is it possible in general to talk about the refutation of entire opening variations? Besides, by 1975 a num¬ ber of new and quite attractive set-ups had appeared on the horizon (among them such incorrect, from the classical point of view, variations as the Chelyabinsk or the ‘Hedge¬ hog5), some of which Fischer could well have adopted. Therefore it would have been more correct to talk not about the refutation of specific opening variations, but about the new ap¬ proach to opening preparation in general. This was the crux of the problem! With his enor- 296 Anatoly the Twelfth mous work in the early 1970s Fischer pre¬ pared a qualitative leap in the development of opening theory — he was the proclaimer of a genuine openings revolution, which began precisely in his ‘golden5 year 1972 and within a little more than ten years logically led the pro¬ gress of chess thinking to my matches with Karpov. To some, these post-Fischer years may seem rather uninteresting, but in chess there was a colossal amount of underground work going on. Fischer’s departure and the politici¬ sation of chess life somewhat diverted atten¬ tion from the creative aspect, which prevented the role of this period in chess development from being properly appreciated (it is for this reason that I have covered Karpov’s most important matches in such detail). Although, in fact, in opening theory truly revolutionary changes were taking place. This topic has proved so fascinating and immense, that have I decided to devote a separate volume to it, the next in the series. So what in fact was Fischer’s key problem? In my view it was that, always working alone, he was simply unable to adapt to the new de¬ mands of preparation, dictated by the opening revolution. The complexity of the resulting problems demanded other methods of work¬ ing, another way of thinking and, which was especially important, the presence of critics. And, hypothetically comparing the pre-match preparations of Fischer and Karpov, one must mention not only the challenger’s advantage in the number and quality of specific prepared variations, but also, in particular, his obvious superiority in the all-inclusive, wide-ranging extent of this preparation. It is quite probable that Fischer, with his keen chess feeling, even before the Karpov- Spassky match clearly realised: a new era had arrived and he had to reject his customary methods of working. With his own eyes he saw the fruits of the revolution he had gener¬ ated, and he was aware that it was no longer possible to prepare properly on his own. In¬ vite some helpers? But he had always worked alone, not trusting his helpers even to analyse adjourned positions! He was aware that seri¬ ous qualitative shifts had occurred, that he had left one kind of chess and would arrive at an¬ other, and that to join the new reality, a huge effort, an incredible spurt was required. He realised that he would have to play against the leader of a generation who had grown up on the wave of the openings revolu¬ tion and had brought these qualitative shifts to chess. Against a cold-blooded fighter, who would not only learn the lessons of his matches with Polugayevsky, Spassky and Korchnoi, and not only use the analyses of the leading Soviet grandmasters, but also display his unique ability to instantly absorb, digest, and successfully put into practice any sound strategic ideas. Observing the qualifying cycle, he realised that Karpov would be especially strong in the first part of the marathon. And Bobby, in view of his psychological instability, most probably began to have serious fears about* a bad start. However, these fears too largely rested on the quality of opening preparation. Fischer sensed that in an encounter with Karpov his prepara¬ tion might not meet the demands of the mo¬ ment. Tom apart by numerous complexes, he ended up in a vicious circle: afraid that you will be unable to prepare properly, because of this you become even more afraid... In short, Fischer was not in fact able to change track, also for the reason that he had not played chess for too long. In the Botvin- nik era it was possible not to play for three years and still retain the title of world cham¬ pion, whereas in the times of the openings revolution three years was a whole eternity! In modem chess history, champions and chal¬ lengers have managed to switch to a different era, but only through being active players. The most titanic work was done in the 1970s by Korchnoi, although Karpov’s determined re¬ building in the mid-1980s (to be described later) was also impressive. I too, although not 297 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors to the same degree, had to rebuild my game after the defeat in my match with Kramnik,.. But let us return to the spring of 1975: on 3rd April FIDE proclaimed Karpov the 12th world champion in the history of chess. And on 24th April in Moscow, in the Hall of Col¬ umns of the House of Unions, the coronation ceremony of the new chess king took place. In his speech Dr Euwe said, among other things: ‘I admire Karpov’s composure, his deep sense of respect and the competitive qualities which he has displayed throughout the time that this matter has lasted (since the match regulations were drawn up). Fischer had every opportunity to defend his title. Fischer’s ob¬ stinacy, or some other features of his character which I, like many others, do not understand, prevented him from utilising his right, and from fulfilling his duty to the chess world. As regards Karpov, of this we are confident: he will be a worthy champion, and will on many occasions demonstrate his strength in various events.’ Euwe recalled, not without some pride, that the first of Karpov’s three thousand moves on the path to the throne was made by him — at the Niemeijer Cup in Groningen (cf. p.209), and he concluded: ‘So it was following my example that Anatoly Karpov became world champion!’ 1 don’t know about Fischer, but I consider the match that we didn’t play to be an enor¬ mous loss,’ Karpov was to say years later. It is not worth guessing how it would have con¬ cluded, but I don’t doubt for an instant that it would have become the most significant event in my life... Of course, I was happy when Max Euwe crowned me with the laurel wreath of world champion. But in that wreath there were not the most important leaves, there was not the most valuable thing for me — memo¬ rable signs of a struggle with my brilliant predecessor.’ Active Champion After gaining the title without a match, Kar¬ pov rushed into the crucible of tournament battles, driven by a desire to demonstrate that he did indeed have no equals in the world. He immediately outlined his credo at the corona¬ tion ceremony: ‘It seems to me that one of the chief obligations of the world champion is to be an active player, so that people from vari¬ ous countries should see the champion at the chessboard, and that grandmasters and mas¬ ters should be able to measure their strength against his, learn from him and teach him something. Therefore I firmly intend to take part systematically in home and international events.’ His ‘debut’ as champion came at the Vid- mar Memorial (Portoroz/Ljubljana, June 1975): 1. Karpov - 11 out of 15 (+7=8); 2. Gligoric — 10; 3-5. Furman, Hort and Ribli — 9Y2; 6-7. Parma and Portisch - 8V2; 8-9. Ljubojevic and Velimirovic — 8, etc. It is noteworthy that in his first-round game with Portisch he chose not his favourite move 1 e4, but 1 <§^£3 — and scored a good win in the Slav Defence (revenge for San Antonio!). From that time onwards ‘serving from both sides’, which had been successfully tested in his match with Spassky and prepared against Fischer, was regularly employed by Karpov, although before the matches with me he nev¬ ertheless had a clear leaning towards 1 e4. Then came the USSR Team Champion¬ ship (Riga, July 1975), where there was a very strong tournament on the top boards: Kar¬ pov, Spassky, Petrosian, Tal, Beliavsky... Anatoly confidently made the best score (+4=3), again defeating Spassky with the help of 1 d4 — this time it was a Queen’s In¬ dian Defence with the successful siege of an isolated d5-pawn. The champion’s next test was a super- tournament in Milan (August-September 1975), a city which had been in contention for the staging of the Fischer-Karpov match and had decided to replace it with another out¬ standing chess event. The competition was held under an unusual formula — in three 298 Anatoly the Twelfth stages: first an all-play-all tournament of 12 grandmasters, then semi-final matches of four games between the players who had taken the first four places (1-4 and 2-3) and a final match of six games. Karpov: 'Here I was simply obliged to be first! The tournament had a grandiose line-up — it was as though it had been devised to test the calibre of the new champion. The world still demanded proof of the legality of the “new regime”. Milan would have to put the dot over the “i”. First of all I had to finish in the first four... When it is a question of the need to be first, after playing 21 games in 25 days against very strong opponents, the crea¬ tive aspect has to take second place.’ After winning three 'Spanish duels’ in the first six rounds — with Black against Ljubo- jevic (deep into the endgame — in a drawn ending with opposite-coloured bishops) and with White against Unzicker and Gligoric, he took the lead. And he could have finished first, had he not lost in the 8th round with White against Anders son. It is symptomatic that Ulf beat Karpov — and before that also Portisch! — with his favourite 'hedgehog’ sys¬ tem, which was then only just gathering speed (in the volume about the openings revolution, a whole chapter will be devoted to this flexible set-up). Karpov liked playing against the 'hedgehog’ and he was thinking only about victory: 'Andersson regularly runs short of time, and I played specially so as to give him food for thought.’ A complicated manoeu¬ vring struggle developed, and Ulf did indeed end up in terrible time-trouble, but when he played ...d6-d5 and made a desperate exchange sacrifice, miracles began: Anatoly made a se¬ ries of 'obvious’ moves and... adjourned the game in a lost position. However, he did not lose his place in the first four and after a bloodless semi-final with Petrosian (2-2, victory on the superior coeffi¬ cient in the tournament) he won the final match against Portisch: 3V2-2V2. The outcome of the entire event was decided by Karpov’s only win, and again with White in a Ruy Lo¬ pez — in the Steinitz Defence Deferred. More details of this difficult match are given in the chapter The Hungarian Botvinnik’ (cf. Volume 3, Game No.40). Tal: 'Not long before the tournament Karpov was indisposed and he played in Italy without his usual verve. In my view, one of the most graphic manifestations of a player’s class is his ability to perform suc¬ cessfully even when he is “off’ his game. It was this that the champion demonstrated in Milan.’ In November Karpov gave some intensive simultaneous displays in a tournament of Pio¬ neers Palaces, held in Leningrad (where, as has already been mentioned, we first met at the board). A couple of weeks later the 43rd USSR Championship was starting, and all the leading players in the country were due to take part: from 1973, after the loss of the crown, the Sports Committee rigorously endeavoured to follow this line. Of course, Karpov too was due to play there, but he had to withdraw on account of fatigue and his poor state of health, which was supported by an official medical report. Unhappy about this news, the head of the chess section Baturinsky wrote a report to Ivonin, the deputy chairman of the Sports Committee: T would ask you to speak personally to A. E. Karpov, and if necessary to the medical officials, in view of the fact that the world champion’s non¬ participation in the national championship, following the rffusal of Korchnoi and Spassky for the second year running, will have unfavourable repercussions,’ But the Leningrad doctors managed to convince the sports directors... It was Petrosian who became national champion, half a point ahead of Vaganian, Gulko, Romanishin and Tal. Thoroughly rested and restored, Karpov set off together with his long-standing friend and rival Rafael Vaganian to the highly prestigious 'Solidarity’ tournament in Skopje (February- March 1976), where four years earlier he had made a brilliant debut at the Olympiad. The pairings brought the rivals together in 299 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the very first round, and again, as three years earlier in Budapest, Vaganian was unable to hold out in his favourite French Defence. 23 Af 5! (it was for the sake of this that White gave up his b2-pawn) 23...2e7? In Karpov’s opinion, "23...gxf5 would also have lost to 24 JSd3 f4 25 ®xf4 Wc2 26 flg3+ <^h7 27 ift6’ (or 27 %4), but c25...f6 was perhaps more tenacious.’ In the computer era it can be said with far more certainty: 23...gxf5! 24 fld3 f4 25 ®xf4 f6! followed by ...Sg7 would have enabled Black to save the game: 26 fig3+ (26 flee3 Bg7! is weaker) 26...1g7 27 #xf6 Ixg3 28 fxg3 Wb6+ 29 <^h2 lft7, or 26 Wxf6 Hg7 27 We6rf <4)h7 28 ®£5+ <4)h8 with a draw. 24 2xe7 £}xe7 25 ±d3! £if5 A difficult choice: in the event of 25...^fS (25...£k6? 26 ±xg6, while if 25...1e8? or 25..3fira3?, then 26 Hel is decisive) 26 Bbl Wd2!

(31...(4>g7, intending ...d5-d4, was still not so clear) 32 He7!, and Black resigned on the 40th move. After this defeat Rafael obviously felt dis¬ heartened, and was no longer in contention for the prize places. One can’t help remembering Korchnoi’s words: "Vaganian is a chess player of enormous practical potential. But he is more of an artist than a fighter. And he needs inspira¬ tion, in order to demonstrate his class. And it, inspiration, is a capricious thing.’ But Karpov, although he expended a mass of energy on this first-round win, managed after a draw with Black against Adorjan (note the opening: 1 e4 c5 2 <2}f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ^3xd4 a6 5 Jtd3 lift7 6 0-0 g6 etc.) to win a further four games in a row! One of them reached an endgame with opposite-coloured bishops, far more refined than the one in his Milan game with Ljubojevic. Game 69 B. Kurajica-A. Karpov _Skopje 1976, 5th round Black’s advantage is largely of an academic nature. It is hard to imagine that anything real can be derived from it. White has no more than perpetual check’ 32 #d3 300 Anatoly the Twelfth Kurajica offers the exchange of queens, be¬ lieving that there are no dangers in this opposite-coloured bishop ending. 32 h4 (Karpov) 32...Hft5 33 Wd3 was slightly more circumspect, but it is hard to criticise seriously the move made: White retained a draw for a long time in the endgame. 32...®xd3 33 cxd3 h4!

After 37..Jte6 38 ±b2 fxg4 39 fxg4 JLb3 40 g5 ±c2 White gives up his d3-pawn and moves his bishop between the squares cl-b2-a3, while if ...if7, then ie5. Of course, 37 ie3 also does not lose, but this is a 'moral’ victory for Black: he seizes space on the kingside and White begins to have difficulties in defending. 37...ih5 38 ±b4 g5 'Here it is, the real threat of a breakthrough — 39..T4+ 40 gxf4 g4! 41 fxg4+ ixg4.

"Even the seemingly most simple positions contain many secrets, and you should play equally carefully in positions with many pieces and castling on opposite sides, as in endings with opposite-coloured bishops and an equal number of pawns. Alas, often it is sufficient to make just one mistake, not even a blunder, to perhaps lose an otherwise well conducted game,’ Karpov summarises. 22 years later an¬ other subtle ending with opposite-coloured bishops occurred in one of his games (Game No. 107). In the 7th round the only ever Reshevsky- Karpov game took place: 1 £rf3 c5 2 c4 £if6 3 g3 g6 4 Ag2 Ag7 5 0-0 0-0 6 d4 cxd4 7 ^xd4 ^c6 8 ^c3 ^xd4 9 #xd4 d6 10 #d3 a6 11 Ad2 Hb8 12 fiacl V2-V2. It is incredible, but true: during his dizzy career the 64-year-old giant of American chess played against eleven world champions! In Skopje Reshevsky made a modest score, suffering from all his usual problems. Karpov: "His devoutness and punctuality in observing the rites of his faith are well known throughout the chess world. His religion pre¬ vents him from playing on Friday evenings. Therefore all the participants agreed to switch their games with Reshevsky on that day of the week to the morning, so that they would finish before sunset On the first Friday Reshevsky was due to meet Vaganian, who regarded the prospect of a morning session with excessive calm, even complete disdain. I was concerned: ""Find out the exact starting time.” Vaganian returned looking discouraged: ""They say early — at ten.” ""On no account. You’re accustomed to getting up late. Don’t even think of agree¬ ing to earlier than noon. Eleven is the very earliest: if your mild character can’t stand it and you start giving way.” And we set off to¬ gether to the organisers. Reshevsky argued, and threatened to leave Skopje, but all the other players supported us. This game, which began at eleven, was conducted brilliantly by Vaganian, and he promptly rushed to the hotel to thank me...’ It seems to me that this episode reveals Karpov’s tough, uncompromising character and partly explains why some brilliant talents become champions, and others do not. Here it should also be explained that Anatoly, like many leading grandmasters, is by nature a "night-owl’, and for him it was always impor¬ tant for play to begin as late as possible. 302 Anatoly the Twelfth The last intrigue of the tournament in Skopje was the finishing encounter between the leaders, Uhlmann and Karpov. The Ger¬ man grandmaster was half a point behind and, it appeared, was bound to try his luck. How¬ ever, he did not achieve anything from the opening (cf. Volume 3, Game No. 71, note to Black’s 7th move) and, dissatisfied with his position, offered a draw. But Karpov again displayed his character: he turned down the peace offer and coldly converted his advan¬ tage into a win. The final result was truly champion-like: 1. Karpov — 12Vz out of 15 (+10=5); 2. Uhlmann — 11; 3. Timm an — IOV2; 4-5. Kura- jica and Tarjan — 9; 6. Velimirovic — 8V2; 7. Adorjan — 8; 8-9. Ivkov and Matanovic — IV2; 10. Vaganian — 7, etc. After the tournament Karpov proudly stated that in percentage terms he had surpassed Fischer’s result in Skopje 1967 (13V2 out of 17). And to the question Who do you consider to be your most dangerous rival?’ without beating about the bush he replied: T don’t see anyone at the moment...’ Apparendy inspired by Karpov’s successes, in March 1976 the Sports Committee adopted an impressive resolution: ‘On the preparation of Soviet chess players for the world champi¬ onship events 1976-78.’ In the preamble it was stated: By fulfilling the Committee’s directives No. 117 of 7 February 1973 and No.48 of 29 May 1974> So¬ viet chess players have achieved significant successes in international competitions and consolidated their lead- ing position in the chess world. At the present time thy hold all the officially contested championship titles in the world and in Europe. Grandmaster A.Karpov, after being proclaimed world champion, has performed in national and foreign competitions, and has achieved fine results and general recognition as the No. 1 player in the world. ’ This resolution approved a three-year ‘Preparation plan for members of the USSR teams for world championship competitions of 1976-78.’ I don’t know to what extent it was fulfilled, but I should like to acquaint you with extracts from this once secret document — a monument to an entire era: Each member of the USSR team should every year play an average of 80 games in six competitions. The control event for each grandmaster, determining his playing load in the following year, is the [/AAR indi¬ vidual championship. The training bad of a member of the UAAR teams is to consist every year of four sessions, of duration totalling 70 days, andfour periods of individual work, of duration totalling 70 days. Every year in January a 24-day training session of the strongest USSR players is to be held at the Sports Committee’s Olympic Base in Novogorsk. During the year training sessions lasting 12-18 days are to be held at Sports Committee bases before official FIDE events and before major international tournaments. Each member of the UAAR team is obliged to keep a diary ofpreparations and performances. The diary is the main report document, reflecting the quality of the player’s preparation andplay. A player’s state of health and general physical preparation are to be constantly monitored by the UAAR chess teams’ doctor. Psychobgicalpreparation is to be carried out at training and medical sessions by specialist consultants and monitored by the UAAR chess teams’ doctor. Schedule for ensuring that members of the UAAR teams and trainers have up-to-date chess information: 1. Study of the games of the leading foreign grand¬ masters (Mecking Lfubojevic, Andersson, Htibner, Smfkal, Portisch, Hort, Larsen, Browne, Kavalek) with a critical analysis, summary of opening repertoire and recommendations. 2. Study of topical problems and writing of confi¬ dential reports *Opening reviews for 1975 (1976, 1977)’. Completion dates — the entire period 1976- 78.

Annual cost of this work approximately 5000 (jive thousand) roubles. In the meantime chess life took its normal course. After the major tournament in Skopje the world champion played in three successive events, each of just six games: in April — the USSR Team Cup in Tbilisi (+2=4), and in May — a double-round tournament of four players in Amsterdam (+2=4). Karpov: The conclusion of this tournament coincided with my 25th birthday, and when the 75-year-old professor Euwe and I appeared on television, the Dutch joked that it was the broadcast of the century/ In July — a similar four-player tournament in Manila (+1—1=4). In the 2nd round the champion lost unexpectedly with White to the idol of Filipino chess fans Eugenio Torre — of course, not in an Alekhine Defence, but in a double-edged variation of the Sicilian: 1 e4 c5 2 ^£3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ^xd4 ^£6 5 £lc3 £\c6 6 AgS e6 7 Wd2 a6 8 0-0-0 Adi 9 f4 b5. ‘And even an excellent win over Ljubojevic could not save me from 2nd place in the event,5 Karpov laments.

Out of 34 games begun with this variation, he won 12 and did not lose a single one! And in general he greatly respected the ‘queen of openings5, remembering Capab- lanca’s precept: the Ruy Lopez is the touch¬ stone of understanding positional play. I, also from childhood, remembered the opinion of another luminary — Keres, who thought that the development of a young player was inconceivable without a knowledge and, above all, an understanding of the subtleties of the Ruy Lopez, and that a knowledge of this opening was necessary for every strong player. 13 b4 (ten years later in Tilburg, Ljubojevic was to play more modestly against Karpov — 13 b3; for 13 a4-c£ Game No. 102) 13...±f8 14 a4 £>b6 15 a5 £>bd7 16 Ab2 16...&b8!

The immediate return of the knight by 21.. .^hf6! was significantly stronger.

White misses his chance. The interposing of 22 Jla7!

Karpov won numerous games thanks to his superiority in understand¬ ing of position, but here he also ‘out- calculated’ an opponent who was famed for his calculating ability. The tournament in Manila is memorable not only for this game. Karpov: eA friend of Fischer — the Filipino Florencio Campomanes, FIDE Vice-President, had long been wanting to arrange a meeting between us. When I ar¬ rived in Manila, Campo confidentially in¬ formed me that Fischer would also be coming. But the tournament ended, and there was still no Fischer... On the way to the airport it tran¬ spired that Campomanes wanted to accom¬ pany me to Tokyo. It was then that I realised that he had somehow agreed to meet Fischer in Japan.’ On 11th and 12th August the champions met for a second time — on this occasion in 306 Anatoly the Twelfth Cordoba in Spain, not far from where, in Mon- tilla, Karpov had won a comparatively minor tournament (+5=4). These discussions are de¬ scribed in more detail in Volume 4. Totvinnik, whom Karpov informed by telephone about his meetings with Fischer, was doubtful: “But are you sure it was really him that you talked with, and not his double?” Yes, this appearance of the former champion came as a complete surprise for everyone.’ (Roshal) But the end of the year was approaching, and with it the most severe examination for the world champion — more severe than many international tournaments: the 44th USSR Championship (Moscow, November- December 1976). Karpov was again suffering from a cold, and in addition his parents were seriously ill, but there was no way that he could withdraw. His appearance was awaited with enormous interest. In its way this was a unique occurrence: earlier, of the Soviet world champions, in the years when they were champion, only Botvinnik had played in the USSR Championship — in 1951, 1952 and 1955 (and only once, in 1952, did he finish first, after a play-off match with Taimanov). Tal: Tor the first time in the history of So¬ viet chess, the title of world champion had been gained before winning the gold medal of champion of the country, but perhaps more important was the fact that it was a long time since chess players had seen Karpov in real “action”. He had gained several victories in international tournaments, but these events did not provoke any particular resonance. At the start of the championship Karpov looked out of training. A couple of draws, and a se¬ vere defeat against Geller — all this appeared to herald a sensation...’ Indeed, it was not easy for Karpov to en¬ dure the loss to Geller (Volume 2, Game No. 102) and the ovation in the hall in honour of his opponent. The sports authorities were also seriously concerned... True, in the 4th round the champion was helped’ by Balashov, who for a long time in their game did not succumb to the ‘Spanish tor¬ ture’, but sealed at the adjournment an indiffer¬ ent move, and at the very start of the resumption (on the 43rd move!) suddenly placed his queen cn prise and promptly resigned. Although, in general, this tournament was probably the best in Balashov’s career this was his only loss and in the second half of the event only he tried to maintain the tempo set by Karpov. By also defeating Kupreichik with White, and drawing with Black against Petrosian (‘a study-like save in a very difficult rook ending") and Romani shin, the world champion some¬ what improved his standing. After seven rounds the position in the leading group was this: Balashov — 5; Dorfrnan and Rashkovsky — 4V2; Geller, Karpov, Petrosian, Polugayevsky and Tal — 4. From this it is evident how com¬ petitively important was the 8th round clash between Karpov and Iosif Dorfrnan (who, in¬ cidentally, also played excellently in the next USSR Championship, sharing lst-2nd places). Tal: This game completely gripped not only the entire auditorium. I was playing on a neighbouring board, and from time to time it occurred to me that the position in it inter¬ ested me more than my own game. I think that many of the players experienced the same feeling: the table at which this battle was tak¬ ing place was constantly surrounded by a tight circle.’ Yes, there were times when even the pragmatic Karpov would himself impose an ultra-sharp struggle on his opponents and in so doing act resourcefully and confidently! Dorfrnan accepted the challenge, and the re¬ sult was a very interesting and unusually com¬ plicated chess spectacle. Game 71 A.

But, as was men¬ tioned in the notes to the game with Hort, 10 1tfh5!? is more unpleasant for Black 10.. .Wc7?! This development of the queen to its usual Sicilian position is not always the best decision. Here, on the contrary, it hinders the most rapid development of Black’s counterattack 10...£lxd4 11 Jtxd4 0-0 12 0-0-0 b5 was neces¬ sary, leaving the c-file for the rook, and allow¬ ing the queen the possibility of going to a5. 11 0-0-0 b5 "Black provokes his opponent into making a sacrifice, apparently not fearing its conse¬ quences.’ (Karpov) 12^xc6! After a long think Karpov decided against the immediate knight sacrifice 12 4tif5, since "the %mschen%ug 12...b4! leads to immense complications — 13 ^d5 exd5 14 exd5 ^de5!\ A thorough analysis (naturally, with the help of a computer) has shown that 15 4tfxg7+ SfefB 16 ^e6+! fxe6 17 dxc6 promises White excel¬ lent prospects in this chaos, for example: \7..Mxc6 18 f4 b3! 19 axb3 Vxhl 20 fxe5 d5 21 ®f2+ <4>e8! 22 Jtg2 (the crafty nature of 18.. .b3 is revealed — the opening of the a-file cancels out the bishop check: 22 Jib5+?? axb5 23 flxhl Haiti-) 22...ttfh2 23 Shi Wxe5 24 ±d4 ±xg5+ 25 hxg5 #xg5+ 26 &bl Hf8 27 We2 and, despite Black’s material advantage, it is hard for him to defend. Karpov considered the natural capture 12.. .ex£5 to be bad because of 13 4tid5 WdS 14 exf5. However, the consequences of 13.. .tta5! 14 exf5 0-0! are not at all obvious: 15 f6 Ad8 16 fxg7 He8 17 tth5 £ke5. One has to give Karpov’s wonderful intui¬ tion its due; it sometimes forced him to run counter to his own calculation of variations — and in so doing to avoid barriers that were invisible even to him! On this occasion too Karpov’s sense of danger did not let him down: his choice of the moment for the 308 Anatoly the Twelfth knight sacrifice proved correct 12.. .#xc6 13 iLd4! b4? Dorftnan practically forces his opponent to sacrifice a piece, hoping that Karpov will be uncomfortable in the resulting positions with a disrupted material balance The two players considered the banal 13.. .0-0 to be too risky. Karpov writes: ‘After castling. Black would immediately have come under a pawn attach’ But, in allowing the Keres Attack, Black should not be afraid of a pawn offensive on the kingside! 14 4id5l exd5 15 Axg7 The alternative attacking plan 15 exd5? Wxd5 16 Axg7 Wxhl 17 flel ^ie5 18 JLxeS dxe5 19 Wxe5 would have been refuted by the simple 19... 0-0! 15...2g8 16 exd5 Wc7 17 Af6 &e5 18 Axed dxe5 19f4 Aid 20 Ah3?l By exchanging the bishop at f5. White ef¬ fectively kills the planned counterplay on the c-file. Even when attacking, Karpov endeav¬ ours to restrict the opponent’s activity! But such prophylactic thinking, when mounting an offensive which demands determined meas¬ ures, does not always prove effective. White would have gained an obvious ad¬ vantage by the immediate 20 fxe5! flc8 21 flh2!, when the black queen cannot go to c4. However, Karpov did not like the fact that his opponent would gain counterplay after 21.. .»a5 22 »£3 b3! 23 Wxb3 (23 WxG? even loses: 23...bxa2! 24 Wxc8+ Ad8 25 Wc6+ 4?f8) 23...ttg6. Here Karpov wrongly cuts short his analysis — after 24 Wf3! Jtd7 25 Sf2 Bg7 26 e6! Black loses quickly. 20.. .6.h3 21 2xh3 2c8 22 fxe5 Again as an alternative Karpov suggests the prophylactic move 22 b3, depriving Black of the c4-square, on which he based his almost saving counterplay. He speaks of an advantage for White after 22...e4 23 ®xe4 *ffi, but this advantage is not secured either by his sug¬ gested 24 £5 Ad6 25 f6 on account of 25.. . tty 7 26 SG Ig6, or by 24 ttxh7 Wfxf4+ 25 *bl Wd6 26 Wf5 fic7. 22.. .®c4! After ending up in a desperate position, Dorfman finds an excellent regrouping. 23 Hdd3?! This natural move was passed over by the commentators, although in many variations it 309 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors is the weakening of White’s back rank that prevents him from victoriously concluding his attack Karpov again adheres to the strategy of restricting the opponent’s possibilities and wants to retain the h4 and g5 pawn pair, which ties down Black’s forces. The sacrifice of these pawns looks more frightening — 23 fihd3! Wxh4 (the regrouping carried out in the game — 23...Wf4+? 24 ibl Bc4, loses quickly here: 25 e6 fle4 26 exf7+ *xf7 27 Wh5+ <4>g7 28 If3) 24 d6 Axg5+ 25 ^bl JSd8 26 e6, but the cool-headed 26.. Jlg6! enables Black to stay afloat: 27 e7 Jtxe7 28 dxe7 Hxd3 29 Wxd3 Wxe7 30 Wd4 fif6. However, genuinely fearful experiences await Black after the prophylactic 24 ^febl! The following illustrative variation concludes with the transition into an endgame, where Black can count on a draw: 24..jlc4 25 d6 Se4 26 Se3! Hxe3 27 Wxe3 ±xg5 28 Wa7 ±d8 29 e6! fxe6 30 Hfl ±f6 31 d7+ <4>e7 32 d8#+ <4>xd8 33 Wa8+ <4>e7 34 Wxg8 Wd4! 35 Wxh7+ Agl 36 c3 bxc3 37 Wc2! Wb6 38 b3 We3. But it is not at all obvious that Black would have been able to negotiate all these mined squares with such small losses. 23.. .«f4+! 24 *b1 lc4! 25 d6 The direct 25 e6 succeeds brilliantly after 25.. .fxe6? 26 d6 Se4 27 Wh5+ Wf7 28 Wdl jtf8 29 Whl! Wb7 30 4>cl! Sg7 31 d7+! flxd7 32 2xd7 9i?xd7 33 Be3, but the central¬ ising 25.. JSe4! again saves Black. For example: 26 exf7+ Wxf7 27 fihe3 flxe3 28 JSxe3 fig6, while the immediate 26 Hhe3 runs into the spectacular 26.. JSxg5H 27 hxg5 Jlxg5. 25.. .5.4! 26 She3 lxe3 Here 26...jSxg5? 27 hxg5 Jtxg5 28 d7+ Sl?d8 no longer works on account of the spec¬ tacular counter-sacrifice 29 Hdl! Wxe3 30 Wxa6! Wc5 31 Wb7, or even the prosaic 29 Wg2! Sxe3 30 Wa8+ with mate. 27 lxe3 #xh4 28 Wf3 #xg5 The other pawn captures are equally bad: 28.. .flxg5? 29 Wc6+ 4>f8 30 dxe7+ <4>xe7 31 a31, or 28...Jlxg5? 29 e6 fxe6 30 Bxe6+ ^d# 31 Wc6! And only the retreat 28...Jld8!, calcu¬ lated without difficulty by the computer and not mentioned by any of the commentators, leaves Black with chances of a successful de¬ fence. The computer goes on to produce some amazing variations, in which the black king feels secure in the middle of the board and which a human player would examine seri¬ ously only in analysis: 29 e6 fxe6 30 Hxe6+ &d7 31 Wf5 (or 31 Ee3 <^xd6 32 Wb7 Wc4! 33 Id3+ *e5 34 b3 Wc5 35 Wb8+ *f5 36 flxd8 Wgl+ 37 <4)b2 Wc5!! with a draw) 31...Wxg5 32 le7+ <*c6 33 Wc8+ ^b5 34 Hb7+ ±b6 35 a4+ bxa3 36 Wd7+ *c5 37 b4+ <4>d4! 38 Wxh7 ±d8 39 Wd3+ *e5. If all this is correct, it must be acknowledged that the far from obvious inaccuracies, committed by Karpov on moves 20 and 23, lost White the greater part of his advantage, leaving him only with the initiative. 29 lei White would have retained a certain advan- tage after 29 *c6+ 4>f8 30 dxe7+ 1fxc7 31 Wh6+ Sg7 32 b3, but I wanted more, and so I “restricted” myself to a quiet - but in fact risky — move.’ (Karpov). The immediate regaining of the piece was objectively the best continuation, but with time-trouble approaching the cham¬ pion continues to build up the pressure. 29...Wg2?! Up till now Dorfman has succeeded in par¬ rying the onslaught, but here he loses the thread of the game. 29...Wg4 30 Wc6+ Wd7, 310 Anatoly the Twelfth as suggested by Karpov, after 31 We4! Ad8 32 ®xh7 would still have obliged Black to defend accurately for a long time - for exam¬ ple, 32...Sf8 33 Bgl a5 34 fig8 ±e7 35 flg7 JLd8, but the final outcome of the battle would have remained unclear. 30 ®f5! (Black obviously overlooked this move) 30...fig6? Premature panic. Now White regains the piece in a highly favourable version. By con¬ tinuing the pursuit of the white queen: 30.. .Wg4! 31 ttxh7 Wg6! (White’s threats can hardly be parried after 31..Jth4 32 fifl fig7 33 Wd3 Wc8 34 fidl), Black would have cre¬ ated the greatest difficulties for his opponent, for example: 32 Wh3 Wg4 33 Wd3 ±h4 34 flfl We6 — Black remains a piece up, not al¬ lowing a definite evaluation of the position to be made. 31 Ifl From this moment all White’s moves, speaking in modem language, tally with the ‘first line of the computer’. 31.. .Wd5 32 dxe7 4xe7 33 #f4! a5 34 ®h4+ 4e8 35 #xh7 Wl3 36 #h8+ 4e7 37 #h4+ 4e8 38 ®c4 ®b7 39 b3 White has succeeded in making an escape square, without lessening the tempo of the attack. Black now has nothing to hope for. 39...2e6 40 2g1 Sxe5 41 fig8+ 4e7 42 #h4+ 4d7 43 #f6! The final subdety, worked out during analy¬ sis of the adjourned position. White forces the rook to retreat, abandoning the a5-pawn to its fate. 43.. .2e7 44 ®f5+ 4d6 45 #xa5 ‘It’s all very well checking, but a pawn is a pawn,..’ the winner philosophically comments. 45.. .2e5 In reply to 45...We4 46 Wb6+ 4e5 47 ®c5+ Karpov gives a variation that is almost 20 moves long, consisting, in his opinion, of the strongest moves for both sides. But, as is well known, any long variation inevitably con¬ tains a mistake. That is the case here: ‘47...4f4 48 Ub8...’ Here 48 %5+ 4f3 49 %2+ 4e3 50 Bg3+ is immediately decisive, but instead of the suicidal 47...4f4 Black can prolong the game with 47...4f6, although the win for White is merely a question of time. 46 «d8+ *e6 47 4b2 f6 48 Sf8 *g7 49 #c8+ 4d5 50 *c4+ 1-0 Karpov: ‘After this psychologically impor¬ tant win things went much better.’ Tal: ‘As often happens, this brilliant win sharply changed not so much the world champion’s tournament position, as his mood. Karpov literally forced his way into the leading group, and then, without reducing speed, began over¬ taking his neighbours in the tournament table one after another.’ For some reason the ex-champion does not mention his meeting with Karpov in the 10th round, in which with Black he chose the same 311 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors variation of the Sicilian as Torre in Manila. On this occasion Karpov was prepared and he employed an interesting novelty, but Tal did not become flustered and offered a clever queen sacrifice, which clearly surprised the champion: he thought for 40 minutes over his reply. And in the end he thought it best to decline the sacrifice and offer a draw. But Tal refused! And indeed, White’s position was already worse, and after a series of inaccura¬ cies by Karpov it became altogether critical. According to eye-witnesses, Baturinsky went very pale at that moment Game 72 A.Karpov-M.Tal 44th USSR Championship, Moscow 1976,10th round 31.. .5fd8 The simple 31...Wd4+ 32 ibl Wxh4 seemed unclear because of 33 g6, but these fears are not shared by computer: after 33.. .fxg6 with the threat of ...flf2 Black is bound to win. £It is difficult to convey what went on at that time in the hall and in the press centre. Everyone kept finding wins for the ex-world champion. But the champion continued to come out unscathed on the board.’ (Roshal) 32 *b1 Hd5? An amnesty! The prophylactic 32...g6! fol¬ lowed by ...2d5(4) would still have retained a winning position. Now, however, White finds the only saving resource. 33 g6! fxg6 34 Sxe6 ficd8 35 Scl! *c3 36 2xg6 2xe5 37 Wf2 fled5 14-14 The draw was greeted by an ovation in the auditorium. That evening Tal looked more than upset... Only after this miraculous escape did Kar¬ pov indeed "force his way into the leading group’. In the next six rounds — an amazing occurrence for him! — he won four games with Black (one of them, with KGrigorian, is men¬ tioned in the notes to Volume 2, Game No. 103), and then also his last game with White. And he concluded the tournament in true cham¬ pion style: 1. Karpov — 12 out of 17 (+8- 1=8); 2. Balashov — 11; 3-4. Petrosian and Polugayevsky — IOV2; 5. Dorfman — 9V2; 6-7. Smyslov and Tal — 9, etc. This USSR Championship provoked a wave of comments throughout the chess world. "One gains the impression that Karpov, for all his frail appearance, was the only com¬ petitor in this marathon who not only main¬ tained his strength, but even continued to in¬ crease the tempo right up to the finish. He had to accomplish a whole series of competi¬ tive feats,’ grandmaster Donner wrote admir¬ ingly. He was echoed by grandmaster Byrne: "Karpov is superior to his opponents in his ability to mobilise all this strength to the ut¬ most at the decisive and most difficult mo¬ ment.’ Early in 1977 the champion as though gained his second wind, and he achieved a series of brilliant results, which left no doubts about his superiority. In March — victory in Bad Lauterberg 1. Karpov — 12 out of 15 (+9=6); 2. Timm an — 10; 3. Furman — 9; 4. Sosonko — 8V2 (ahead of Hiibner, Olafsson, Gligoric, Miles, Anders son, Torre...). In April — an impressive 5 out of 5 at the European Team Championship in Moscow (wins over Smejkal, Ljubojevic, Gheorghiu, Portisch and Keene). In May - triumph in Las Palmas: 1. 312 Anatoly the Twelfth Karpov - 13V2 out of 15 (+12=3); 2. Larsen - 11; 3. Timman — 10 (ahead of Tal, Browne, Adorjan, Miles...). And only at the summer super-tournament in Leningrad, dedicated to the 60th anniver¬ sary of the October Revolution, did fatigue obviously begin to tell: Karpov finished be¬ hind Romani shin, Tal and Smyslov. However, even in this tournament he played several ‘purely Karpovian games5. Here is one of these.

Karpov — 8 out of 11 (+5=6); 2. Miles - 7; 3-6. Hort, Hiibner, Kavalek and Timman — 6, etc. Soon, after the final Candidates match (cf. the chapter ‘Belgrade Revenge7), Karpov’s opponent in the match for the world champi¬ onship was determined. To the dissatisfaction of the Soviet officials, it was the defector Vik¬ tor Korchnoi, As preparation for their coming encounters, both grandmasters played in strong tournaments in early 1978: one — in Wijk aan Zee (1. Portisch — 8 out of 11; 2. Korchnoi — 714; 3. Andersson — 614, etc.), and the other — in Bugojno (1-2. Karpov and Spassky — 10 out of 15; 3. Timman — 9, etc.). The chess world, divided into West and East, hushed in anticipation of the long- awaited battle for the chess crown. Baguio through the Eyes of Karpov The match in Baguio was the most troubled, the most scandalous event that I have ever taken part it/ recalls Karpov. ‘Chess, the es¬ sence of which is a means of contact and mu¬ tual understanding between people, was trans¬ formed by Korchnoi into a field of animosity. Neither before nor after have I known anything like it.. The match began rather ponderously. We tried to become accustomed to each other. probing to discover who was in what sort of form; we weren’t in a hurry to reveal our trumps. After all, the match — for the first time in half a century — was unlimited, up to six wins. It was not possible to predict how long it would last I only knew one thing: there was no reason to hurry.’ This match regulations, which had a signifi¬ cant influence on the course of chess history, had an interesting origin. They were drawn up by a special FIDE committee, the first meet¬ ing of which took place back in February 1976 in Amsterdam. From the USSR those who participated in the work were Karpov and Baturinsky, representing the Soviet Chess Federation. At that time, naturally, Karpov spoke against an unlimited match, which had been foisted on chess society by Fischer. The Soviet side suggested playing to six wins, but with a limit of 24-30 games, and in the event of a tie the champion would retain his tide. Baturinsky: ‘However, it very soon became clear that the majority — and in particular the FIDE President Dr Euwe — were already set on an “unlimited” match. The discussions reached an impasse... But Euwe must be given his due — he found an interesting way out: not to place a limit, but to play to six wins (and not ten, as Fischer insisted in his time); with a score of 5-5 the world champion would retain his title, but — a very important addition! — “the challenger would gain the right to play a new match with the champion within a year”. Then Euwe made another half step: the sec¬ ond match, if it was required, would be played with a restricted number of games. Everyone agreed to this, and yet it was not felt that this was the final decision.’ Everything was finally decided in the au¬ tumn of 1977 in Caracas, at a meeting of the FIDE Central Committee. One of the partici¬ pants, grandmaster Averbakh, recalls that on the day of his arrival the Executive Director of the USA Chess Federation, Ed Edmondson, asked him to arrange a meeting with Karpov before the Committee began its work 315 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ‘And that evening they met with me pre¬ sent Edmondson immediately took the bull by the horns: “What regulations do you pre¬ fer?” And to my surprise Karpov said: “I would agree to play to six wins, and with a score of 5-5 — to the first win, but in this case I would like to have the right to a return match/ (Although long before this FIDE had abol¬ ished return matches. — G.K) “Excellent!” Edmondson exclaimed, “I will help to con¬ vince the committee members to adopt your conditions.” And it all went through smoothly at the meeting of the Central Committee. The “local boss” Tudela, a well-known FIDE offi¬ cial, took the floor and proposed the condi¬ tions expressed above by the champion, add¬ ing “Only, we must ask Mr Karpov whether he is agreeable to these conditions?” Anatoly Evgenyevich graciously agreed... Edmondson merely gave a cunning smile. In Baguio, with Karpov’s approval, he was appointed a mem¬ ber of the appeal jury/ Karpov’s speech was recorded for posterity by another eye-witness of these events, the press attache of the Soviet delegation, Roshal: ‘Many wish to see something new. Very well, I am prepared to play an unlimited match, even after having played such a large number of games in tournaments. Some are against the world champion having a draw “in reserve” — I also agree with that I hope that I will not be required to play a return match. But if it should happen that way, that the challenger wins, then together with him the whole chess world will win too: millions of chess enthusi¬ asts will receive a new stimulus towards the popularisation of our game in the form of a highly interesting return match. I am prepared to support this compromise.’ According to Roshal, the delegates began applauding Karpov even before the end of his speech, and ‘only Euwe expressed some reser¬ vations about granting the world champion the right to a return match only in the event of him losing 5-6, but here he himself sensed that he was on his own.’ The decision was ap¬ proved almost unanimously. No one asked for the opinions of Korchnoi and Spassky, the participants in the final Candidates match. The situations that arose at the finish of the 1978 and 1984/85 matches could not then have been foreseen even in a terrible dream... Of course, Karpov was considered the fa¬ vourite in the match, but it should be borne in mind that not long before it started he suf¬ fered a severe, irreplaceable loss. In March 1978 Semion Furman died — he had been the champion’s permanent mentor, an out¬ standing chess theoretician, who understood, like no one else, the nature of his protege’s talent and who had successfully solved the strategic preparation tasks. ‘Furman’s death killed something in me,’ Karpov was to say years later. ‘I was as though enslaved and I could not relax, in order to take in anything new, make it my own — and thereby change myself. The absence of novelty led to bore¬ dom, and for this reason alone I was unable to force myself to work, as once I had selflessly laboured worked with Furman.’ Before Baguio, for personal reasons, a sec¬ ond trainer of the champion — Yuri Razuvaev — also ‘retired’. Reserves had to be mobilised: v the main personnel of the renewed team — Balashov, Zaitsev and Tal — had been well known to Karpov for a long time. This pow¬ erful brigade ‘unearthed’ numerous novelties, and yet it seems to me .that the absence of Furman’s consolidating hand was sometimes felt over the lengthy distance of a very difficult match. Especially for this book, the champion’s long-standing trainer, grandmaster Igor Zait¬ sev, has shared his memories of those distant days: ‘Our first, 18-day training session before Baguio took place in early spring 1978 not far from Sochi, in the picturesque environs of the famous Krasnaya Polyana. Apart from the chess players — Karpov, Vasyukov and me — also present at the session was Vladimir Zuk- har, a professor of medicine, Valery Krylov, 316 Anatoly the Twelfth an experienced physical trainer, and Viktor Bobylev, a chef, who later accompanied Kar¬ pov on neady all his travels for many years. I was participating for the first time in such a colourful gathering. Everything here was new to me: from the relaxed Karpov, competing desperately at billiards, to the daily one and a half hour walks in the intoxicating mountain air with a discussion of all kinds of chess and non-chess events... ‘There then followed a thorough, six-week training session for the champion in the Georgian city of Gagry, with the participation of Tal, Balashov and the author of these lines. Here the training group that was to fly out with Karpov to the Philippines was set up, and the range of opening problems, which we might encounter in the match with Korchnoi, was outlined. ‘Although work on opening variations is in a state of constant flux, during a match itself one usually can only find various types of cor¬ rections and interesting micro-ideas. The pro¬ duction of large-scale analysis work is pre¬ vented by the everyday match commotion. For genuine theoretical dawnings and discov¬ eries, prolonged deep concentration is re¬ quired and even isolation. Therefore it was desirable to prepare all the main opening sur¬ prises before the match, and during it only to vary and refine the ideas found. Tor White our analytical group was con- standy looking at the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez, and, of course, the French De¬ fence with 3 ^d2 (just in case, we also worked on variations with the most critical continua¬ tion 3 £}c3). For Black we studied three fields which caused us a mass of problems: the variation of the Queen’s Gambit with 5 dLf4, the Carlsbad set-up and all possible variations of the English Opening. Tn our training group the chess specialisa¬ tion took place almost of its own accord. The tone in the analysis was set by the two out¬ standing players — Tal and Balashov. In addi¬ tion, both of them possessed an outstanding and highly organised memory, and they could always offer exhaustive encyclopaedic infor¬ mation on any branch of theory, It was no accident that Furman, when exhorting young players, impressed on them: “If you want to know the latest word in theory, follow Tabs games: he picks up new ideas more quickly than others!” Balashov’s memory easily ac¬ commodated all the classics and the entire body of modern opening theory. At the same time, you could always find out from him, for example, what day of the week it was on 31 October 1892, when Alekhine was bom. I also cannot complain of my memory (I still give blindfold simultaneous displays), but when I encounter phenomenal manifestations of it — say, with Balashov, Tal, Kasparov or Ivan¬ chuk, I involuntarily feel the great difference. cIn this division of labour I was usually as¬ signed the rather honourable role of the “clear head” — a person capable of looking at a posi¬ tion with unprejudiced eyes and from an un¬ expected angle. Apparendy, thanks to these qualities, I was able to invent a whole series of completely new opening schemes and numer¬ ous improvements in variations during my period of active collaboration with Karpov. ‘The villa in Baguio, where Karpov was ac¬ commodated, was a gigantic old building, re¬ maining from virtually the times of the con¬ quistadors. A special tent of solid polyethylene was constructed above us so that no instru¬ mentation could listen to us during our prepa¬ rations. However, it wasn’t possible to remain inside such a confined space for long: within some forty minutes it became hard to breathe and your face became covered in a film of water (we are talking about the oceanic sub¬ tropics!). In good weather, after dividing into pairs, we would do our analysis in an open space on the first floor from morning till eve¬ ning, with a short break for lunch. But as soon as it became dark, bats suddenly began noisily flying about and the entire space was filled with myriad insects and moths. And willy-nilly we had to move back into out polyethylene 317 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors paradise... During three months of searchings and anguish, we gave birth to a number of good ideas, although some “miscarriages” also occurred, as Tal wittily commented.’ The first game lasted only two hours. Kar¬ pov: ‘After making my 18th move, I offered a draw with full justification. Korchnoi thought a little, and then, without replying, gave it up as a bad job and began signing his score-sheet. I also signed my score-sheet and handed it to him; he pushed his somewhere to one side and, without looking up, signed my score- sheet. Then he quickly left, without offering his hand to me. But I thought that it was no less essential to do this, than before the start of a game (Tal, who was also present, was of the same opinion). Yes, Korchnoi immediately indicated that he saw the handshake as a pure formality.’ It would appear that for Karpov this was one of those drops, which soon overfilled his cup of patience. Another episode occurred after the drawn 2nd game, where there was an ending with rook and bishop against rook and knight. Anatoly reported that Korchnoi had said: ‘Karpov heard somewhere that a bishop is better than a knight. In the hands of Leonid Stein, perhaps, but not in his!’ There were also verbal attacks on Tal, to say nothing of Doc¬ tor Zukhar, who had already landed on the 4th row (about this — cf. the chapter ‘Baguio through the Eyes of Korchnoi’). And as a re¬ sult, Karpov suddenly refused to shake hands before the 8th game, which unsettled Korchnoi. This was a violation of the rules, and at the champion’s request Roshal read out a statement in the press centre, explaining the reasons for this act: ‘...Recent events have shown that the challenger has no intention of rejecting his course of aggravating the situa¬ tion. Under such circumstances Karpov does not wish to shake hands with Korchnoi.’ However, in the given instance we are more interested in what happened on the chess¬ board. Let us again hand over to Zaitsev: ‘From the character of the opening battle we soon sensed that Korchnoi had prepared not haphazardly, as we had, but more pur¬ posefully and thoroughly, having firmly de¬ cided in advance the range of variations and set-ups which he intended to uphold in the match. The start of the match proved anxious: in the 3rd and 5th games Karpov encountered serious problems with Black, in the second of these saving himself from defeat only by a miracle (Game No.29). Any player who is plan¬ ning to perform successfully hopes in the first instance for success with the white pieces, but in the initial games Anatoly was quite unable to gain any marked advantage in the Open Variation of the Spanish. In the 2nd game Korchnoi deliberately “fed” us a second-rate and, I would say, not very high-quality nov¬ elty. At home we quickly established its flaws, but in the 4th game the challenger, as though driven by some kind of special sense, deviated and again renovated the variation. And only in the 8th game was Karpov able finally to refute the opponent’s risky opening strategy (cf. p.120). The fact that Karpov managed tq cope with a difficult problem at the board had far- reaching consequences. ‘Korchnoi, who by nature was a keen ob¬ server, had no doubt noticed long before that in the opening Karpov only very rarely plays for a direct refutation of the opponent’s plan and is usually prepared to satisfy himself with a solid positional solution, transferring the centre of gravity to middlegame manoeuvring. Only this can explain the occasional appear¬ ance in Korchnoi’s Black repertoire of theo¬ retically not altogether reliable variations — such as 4...f5 in the Spanish (20th game of the 1974 match). In Baguio we thought it possible that the Riga and Berlin Variations might be played once (a variety of the latter turned up later in Merano). And we thought that his ex¬ perience of employing the Dragon — a success in the 5th game of their training match (1971) and a catastrophe in the 2nd game of the Candidates match (Game No.67) — should have indicated to Korchnoi just how danger- 318 Anatofy the Twelfth ous it was to repeat dubious experiments against Karpov. However, in Baguio, when the champion was acting not very confidently, the challenger adhered to this risky course. 'In my view, Korchnoi very keenly sensed his opponent’s condition and in general was distinguished by his outstanding psychological perception. In 1974 I was seconding Petrosian in his losing match with Korchnoi and I re¬ membered for ever a highly unusual incident. During the 5th game, which proved to be the last in the match, in a fit of temper I made some harmless comment about Viktor Lvo¬ vich in a quiet whisper. Play was taking place in the enormous hall of the drama theatre, and on this occasion I was sitting in the dress cir¬ cle, quite a long way from the stage... But, oh horror: Korchnoi, who was thinking over his move, instantly turned his head and from among the thousand-strong mass of support¬ ers he fixed his gaze on me! 'After opening his account in the 8th game, Karpov tried to build on his success in the 10th by employing my sharp novelty in the Open Variation — 11 ^3g5!? I had brought this idea to Krasnaya Polyana, and Karpov imme¬ diately took a fancy to it* we were constantly trying to perfect it. It became our heavy artil¬ lery, and it only remained to await a conven¬ ient moment to bring it into action. The knight sacrifice created a genuine furore in the chess world, but, alas, it did not produce the practical effect that we had hoped for. After thinking for a total of about an hour, Korchnoi made his way excellently through the tactical nuances and found a defence (cf. Volume 2, Game No. 118). ‘And so, the theoretical torpedo missed its target, without having any marked influence on the competitive course of the match. But it nevertheless had a definite mutual psychologi¬ cal effect. The opponent saw that in the open¬ ing we had not only light machine-guns, but also howitzers, and he began acting far more cautiously. But the same episode also forced all of us to pull ourselves together: we had seen Korchnoi’s enormous chess potential with our own eyes.’ Karpov: The win in the 8th game did not lessen the tension that was growing in me with every day. I needed to change my play more decisively, but as yet I was not ready for that. And in the 10th game this told. Korchnoi withstood a very heavy blow and defended brilliantly, whereas I did not exploit all my opportunities. It didn’t work immediately — and I was as though reconciled to this, and did not bother seeking a win. Here I should have taken a time-out, but I didn’t think to do that, and I set off for the next game.’ After his defeat in the 11th game the champion finally took a time-out, but the rest did not bring any relief: 'Everything should be done at the right time!’ When he went along to the 12th game, he did not feel any desire to play: In this game I somehow just served my time. If Korchnoi had realised my condition, I would have been in trouble. But I successfully imitated the desire to gain immediate revenge, composure, confidence, energy — and he { thought only about equalising, and after achieving it he did not conceal his satisfaction. The danger was over... But the crisis could not last for ever. The turning point game in the 13th game. Not before, nor after — during the game. But the game began like the preceding ones: I played without desire, as though de¬ tached, increasingly unable to keep pace with my opponent’s thoughts...’ Game 74 V.Korchnoi-A.

Karpov: "I sat down at the board in one condition, and stood up from it in another. I sensed a turning point — I suddenly realised that I was seeing everything with different, former, pre-crisis eyes: every¬ thing suddenly became vivid, distinct and in¬ teresting. How this game would end also sud¬ denly became interesting to me. And the fact that subsequently I would play well, at full strength, was something that I had no doubts about.’ 41 Ba7 Korchnoi thought over this secret move for 40 minutes! The adjourned position is cer¬ tainly unpleasant for Black — one of those where there is no clear way to draw, but also no forced win. The two players had a few days for analysis, and it was established that neither 41 f4, nor 41 <53b4, nor 41 ^c5 gave any real winning chances. The sealed move was also subjected to a thorough analysis. Korchnoi: ‘In search of the unattainable, I spent half the night with my helpers, got tired and the following day decided to take a time¬ out — to postpone the resumption.’ And this took place only after the 14th game, which was also adjourned, but in a hopeless position for him. Thus, for the first time in the history of world championship matches, two games were resumed on the same evening. This was one of the culminating moments of the battle in Baguio! As the course of the resumption showed, the analysis of the Karpov brigade was deeper. 41.. JSdf6! The endgame after 41...®e6 42 ®xe6 Bxe6 43 Ba6 is very unpleasant in view of the threat of d4-d5.’ (Karpov) 42 Sxf 7 After 42 Sb7 the best defence is offered by 42. JLffil (42...*h7?? 43 e4!) 43 Bxf7 Bxf7 44 &e5 Wxf2+ 45 *hl Ad6 46 £kf7 Wxf? 47 Wxc6 Wc7!, and ‘after the exchange of queens the endgame with opposite-coloured bishops is drawn’ (Karpov). But White has a possibility of retaining the queens — 48 ^a8+ si?g7 49 ®al. Now after 49...g5 the exchange of queens and a draw results from 50 e4 Jlf4 51 e5 #cl+ 52 ®xcl Axel 53 d5 Ah2 54 e6 Aa3, but 50 Jle4 leaves White some chances of success. 42.. JSxf7 43 d5 43..JLe5! Excellent! The bishop is ideally placed on the b8-h2 diagonal, where it is not only block¬ ing the pawn, but also eying the white king. ‘And the exchange of the bishop (44 ^3xe5 Wxe5) would have made things easier for Black’ (Karpov). According to the champion, this key move was suggested by Baturinsky, the leader of the Soviet delegation (who was a 322 Anatoly the Twelfth solid candidate master). 44 dxc6 Paired with its colleague on the e-file, the passed d-pawn would have been hard to stop, but the separated e- and c-pawns do not pre¬ sent any danger. 44.. .<A)g7 45 ±e4 Here Korchnoi was again in time-trouble: the manoeuvre 43...Jte5 obviously came as a surprise to him. However, White’s position, if he is still dreaming of winning, is not so easy to strengthen. The advance of the pawns weakens his own king. Thus after 45 e4 Wh5 the threat of ...We2 forces 46 £ixe5 ttxe5. And if 45 f4 Jtc7 46 e4 there is the strong manoeuvre 46...Wa5, forcing White to act cau¬ tiously: if 47 Wd4+ ^h7 48 ^h2, then 48...g5! 45.. .®g5+ 46 *f1 ±d6 47 ±dS Be7 48 ±f3 48...h5 Tal approves of this move, £just in case’ de¬ priving the white bishop of the g4-square and expanding the king’s shelter. The less ambi¬ tious 48...HT6 would also not have left White any particular chances of success — both in the endgame after 49 ®d4 Wxd4 50 exd4 4?f8 51 %\b2 (51 ±g4 <&>e8 and ...*d8) 51...fle6 52 4^7, and in the event of 49 <5if4 (49 ±e4 Weflff) 49.. Jhrf4 50 exf4 Wd6. 49 ±d1 In severe time-trouble Korchnoi does not want to take any radical decisions and only after the 56th move does he intend to weigh up the possibilities of playing for a win. The exchange of queens 49 ®d4+ ®f6 50 Wxf6+ ‘tfexfb would have led to an equal endgame, for example: 51 h4 Ba7 52 ±d5 Sa5 53 e4 g5! 49.. .«f5 50 *e2 2e4 51 #c3+ «f6 (51...(4)h7? was dangerous: 52 c7 fie8 53 1x2!) 52 #b3 Again avoiding the exchange of queens, which would be equivalent to a draw offer: 52 ®xf6+ <4>xf6 53 Jtb3, and if 53...Sh4, then 54 f4 fixh3 55 £if2 Hh4(2) 56 Sii?f3 with the threat of <4*g3. 52.. .#f5 53 Wb7+ (again avoiding 53 Wc3+ Wf6 54 ®xf6+; Korchnoi wants to enter the new time control with the queens on — he is still hoping to win!) 53...Be7 54 Wb2+ &h7 55 #d4 lc7 56 #h4?? With his last move before the time control White blunders, removing his queen to the edge of the board. The cool-headed 56 1§c5, although it would have allowed the exchange of queens — 56...®xc5 (after 56...Wf6 57 Jtb3 Korchnoi would have achieved his aim — a complicated position with the queens on) 57 £ixc5 etc. would have allowed him to play on with the draw in hand. 56.,.2e4! 57 f4 (to save the queen, this pawn has to be advanced at the most inap¬ propriate moment) 57...1b6! 58 lc2 Bxe3+ 59 4>d2 #a5+ 60 *d1 #a1+ 61 *d2 2e4 0-1 The was one of Korchnoi’s Filipino trage- 323 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors dies (along with the 5th and 17th games). It was amazingly impractical: to think over the sealed move for 40 minutes, and then take a time-out... Oleg Skuratov, a friend from his youth, wrote: ‘Viktor never spared himself, never husbanded his strength. This extrava¬ gance reverberated especially strongly in Ba¬ guio. Seeing his fatal oversights, I involuntarily remembered Korchnoi the student, playing blitz games for days on end. Carried away by the play, he did not think about the conse¬ quences of such stress.’ Karpov too used to be carried away by blitz, but in his case one should rather talk about the consequences of the stress of playing protracted matches. In the 14th game the champion’s staff finally found the key to a variation in which the chal¬ lenger had gained two draws at the start of the match. Karpov: 1 conducted this game in my best traditions.’ On encountering another nov¬ elty, Korchnoi held on with all his migh t, but dose to the 30th move he cracked under the burden of an exhausting, laborious defence. Game 75 A.Karpov-V.Korchnoi World Championship Match, Baguio 1978, 14th game Ruy Lope% C82 1 e4 e5 2 £if3 £ic6 3 ±.b5 a6 4 J,a4 £if6 5 0-0 ®xe4 6 d4 b5 7 ±b3 d5 8 dxe5 iLe6 9 c3 (9 4ibd2 — Game Nos.85 and 86) 9.. .1Lc5 10 £>bd2 0-0 11 Ac2 Af5 12 £ib3 £g4 Three years later in Merano, Korchnoi suc¬ cessfully tried 12...jtg6! (Game No.35). 13 h3!? A surprise! The usual unpretentious play for the advantage of the two bishops — 13 £\xc5 <Sixc5 14 fiel, as in Bronstein-Flohr (USSR Championship 1944), Euwe-Eliskases (Mar del Plata 1947) and Fischer-Larsen (Santa Monica 1966), did not bring White any dividends in the 2nd and 4th games here. 13.. Jk,h5 Karpov merdy mentioned the sharper move 13...Jtxf3, while Tal called it not unfa¬ vourable for White. Indeed, it is hard to de¬ ride, the more so without special analysis, on the unclear play after 14 gxf3 (14 ®xf3?l 4£\xe5 Navarro-I.Ivanov, Cienfuegos 1980) 14.. .£\xf2 15 Sxf2 ±xf2+ 16 &xf2 £>xe5 or 16.. .®h4+ 17 <4>g2 4ixe5 — the white bishops may have their say! 14 g4! ±g6 This position was considered quite accept¬ able for Black, but the champion’s staff had prepared a new idea, which struck the 12.. . Jtg4 variation a serious blow. 15 JLxe4! Tt occurred to me that it is possible to go by force into an endgame, where the presence of opposite-coloured bishops does not diminish, but even increases White’s advantage.’ (Kar- pov) 15.. .dxe4 16 £\xc5 exf3 17 ±W. The basis of White’s idea. Karpov does not miss the opportunity to gain another small plus: to save his £3-pawn, Black himself is forced to exchange queens — and to present his opponent with an extra tempo. 17.. .®xd1 ‘After l7..Me7 White gains a tempo by 18 Wd5 £>a5 19 b4 £>c4 20 Sfel, and the £3- pawn is lost.’ (Karpov): 20...a5! 21 a3! etc. 18 2axdl£id8! The best defence. Black exchanges the strong knight at c5 and creates a strong point 324 Anatoly the Twelfth in the centre for his bishop, thereby retaining his f3-pawn. Korchnoi even allows the enemy rook onto the 7th rank, as he sees how it will be possible to drive it out from there. 19 2d7 ®e6 20 ®xe6 fxe6 21 Ae3 (Kar pov reached this position at home) 21 ...fiac8 The exchange of one pair of rooks after 21..JSf7?i 22 flfdl (Karpov) 22...flaf8 23 Ac5 Ixd7 24 fixd7 Hc8 25 <4>h2 Ae4 26 <4>g3 Ad5 27 h4 would have allowed White real winning chances. 22 Sfdl 22.. .1e4! At just the right time. Delaying with 22.. .h5?! would have conceded the 7th rank to White: 23 gxh5 AxhS 24 He7 and fldd7 (Karpov). 23 Ac5! Forcing the rook to leave the f-file and take up a passive position; but the white rook too is forced to retreat, and this is an undoubted achievement for Black. 23.. .2fe8 24 27d4 (after 24 4>h2 Ac6 the rook would have been driven from d7) 24.. .Ad5 25 b3 a5 26 <ih2 2a8 27 <4?g3 2a6 After achieving success in setting up a de¬ fence, Korchnoi relaxed and decided to try and prevent c3-c4 by simple means. He avoided the more tenacious 27...a4 28 c4 bxc4 29 bxc4 Ac6, possibly not noticing that if 30 a3 there is the strong reply 30...fia5! Karpov asserts that even without 30 a3 White has an obvious positional advantage', but it would have merely consisted in complete domination of the d-file, on which there are no invasion squares. White would then have had to try and open a second front on the kingside... 28 h4 Hc6? A serious error. It was not yet too late to play 28...a4, but Korchnoi is carried away by the faulty idea of transferring his rook and he does not sense the danger. 29 Hxd5! In the event of the ‘obvious' 20 b4 Black would hardly have been in danger of losing. With this unexpected exchange sacrifice Kar¬ pov discloses the flaw in Korchnoi's plan, exploiting the fact that for the moment the enemy rooks lack coordination. Black is again inundated with problems. 29.. .exd5 30 2xd5 Hce6 31 Ad4 c6 32 Sc5 Just three moves have passed, but how strikingly the situation on the board has changed! Black's rooks are passively placed, his queenside pawns are obvious targets, and the f3-pawn is altogether doomed. If the white pawn phalanx should begin advancing, Black will be unable to hold out. 32.. .2f8? Now the game cannot be saved. Black's defensive resources were far from ex¬ hausted, and in the first instance he should have exchanged rooks: 32...fld8! 33 c4)xf3 2d5 34 HxdS cxd5. In this case White's task 325 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors would have been seriously complicated, and perhaps it would have become altogether unrealisable! Analysis diagram If White moves his king, preparing to ad¬ vance the f-pawn, Black finds very convincing counterplay; 1) 35 *g3 b4! 36 f4 flc6! 37 cxb4 axb4 38 £5 flc2 39 e6 Bxa2 40 4*0 (in the event of 40 g5?

However, White can forestall the counter¬ play with ...h7-h5 (by 35 h5) or with ...b5-b4 (35 a3). Thus: 3) 35 h5 b4! (35...Sc6 36 <4>e3 or 36 a3! leads to variations already examined; the me¬ chanical forestalling of the advance is less good — 35...g5 36 hxg6 hxg6 37 4)e3 g5 38 f4! gxf4+ 39 4>xf4 4>f7 40 <4>f5 fic6, and after 41 a3 it transpires that manoeuvring the rook between c6, e6 and g6 does not give a draw, for example: 41...a4 42 bxa4 bxa4 43 g5 Be6 44 lc5, and after 44...Bc6 there follows 45 !d6l, while if 44...flg6 — 45 le7!, then lf6, and White’s passed pawns begin advancing) 36 4?e3 Sc6! 37 4?d3 (in the event of 37 cxb4 axb4 38 f4 Sa6 things are simpler for Black) 37...g6! 38 hxg6 Bxg6 39 f3 &{7 40 cxb4 axb4 41 lc5 Sa6, achieving saving counterplay after both 42 <4>d4 Bxa2 43 4>xd5 Id2+ 44 ld4 Bd3 45 f4 fixb3 46 e6+ sfeeS 47 f5 Bd3 48 4?e4 fig3 49 4?f4 Bd3, and 42 lxb4 Bxa2 43 ld6 2£2 44 *e3 Bfl 45 b4 d4+ 46 4>xd4 Bxf3 47 b5 4>e6 48 b6 fib3; 4) 35 a3! Analysis diagram 326 Anatoly the Twelfth This is how Karpov %as intending to con¬ tinue, in order to create a fortress on the queenside by b3-b4 and only then advance the kingside pawns/ This gives the greatest chances of success: White hinders the activa¬ tion of the rook and plans 4g3 and f2-f4. Here 35...h5? is a pawn sacrifice, which Black cannot permit himself: 36 gxh5 fle8 37 4g4 (37 b4!?) 37...b4 38 axb4 axb4 39 cxb4 Sb8 40 Jtc5 d4 41 4f4, and White should win. And passive defence by 35...g6? is gradually breached after 36 4g3: Karpov gives only the hopeless 36...fle8? 37 f4 Sf8 38 e6 (38 h5! is even better), but 36...h5 also does not help — 37 f4 hxg4 38 4xg4 if? 39 4g5 (not 39 h5? gxh5+ 40 4xh5 S.g6 41 f5 Hg2, and with his king cut off, White cannot win) 39.. J5e8 40 f5 gxf5 41 4xf5 fle6 42 Ac3 Hc6 43 ±d2 (the h-pawn is ready to advance, and Black’s coun¬ terplay is too late) 43...b4 44 axb4 axb4 45 cxb4 flc2 46 e6+ etc. Therefore Black must aim for the immedi¬ ate activation of his rook — 35...fic6!, and in the event of 36 4g3 b4! 37 axb4 axb4 38 cxb4 Icl 39 e6 flel 40 ±e3 (or 40 b5 Sxe6 41 b6 Se7 42 f4 g6) 40...4f8 41 4f4 4e7 42 4e5 d4 43 4xd4 4xe6 it would appear that he gains a draw. White can radically suppress the idea of ...b5-b4 by 36 b4 (‘a la Karpov5), but then the a-file is opened for the rook: 36...axb4 37 axb4 4>f7 38 &g3 '4>e6 39 f4 g6 40 h5 Ia6 41 ^>h4 Ha2 42 'A’gS flg2 with equality. Instead of 38 sfcgS it is stronger to play 38 <4>£4!, and after 38.. .6e6 39 &g5! or 38...Ha6 39 4>f5! g6+ 40 <4>g5 flat 41 f4 flfl 42 f5 gxf5 (42...h6+ 43 i’xhO gx£5 44 g5!) 43 gxf5 h6+ 44 l*l?g4 things are clearly bad for Black. But here too he finds a reply: 38...h6! 39 h5 g6 40 hxg6+ flxgfi, and since if 41 4?£5 there is 41...Sg5+, if 41 4g3 — 41.. .h5 and if 41 £3 - 41...4e6, White has to be satisfied with a draw. Now, in search of a win, the following line very much suggests itself: 36 4f4 4f7 37 4 £5, and after 37...h6? 38 h5 followed by f2- f4 Black most probably is unable to hold out. He must play energetically: 37...g6+ 38 4g5 b4! 39 axb4 axb4 40 cxb4 Bel 41 £4 Bdl! (41...Sfl? 42 h5 h6+ 43 4xh6 gxh5 44 f5! hxg4 45 e6+ 4e7 46 4g6, and the white pawns are irresistible) 42 Jtc5 d4 43 f5 gxf5 44 gxf5 h6+! (not immediately 44...d3? on account of 45 e6+ 4g8 46 f6) 45 4f4 (45 4xh6? d3, and it is Black who wins) 45...d3 46 e6+ 4e8 47 4e3 d2, and in view of the exchange of the d2-pawn for one of the con¬ nected passed pawns, it is a draw. A more refined version of the same plan is 41 b5!? (instead of 41 f4). By forcing the op¬ ponent to deal with the b-pawn, White in the meantime hopes to achieve mote on the op¬ posite wing: 41...flbl 42 f4 Hxb3 43 £5 (43 b6 Hb4) 43.. JSxb5 44 e6+ 4e7. Analysis diagram Going for the h7-pawn — 45 4h6 leads to the isolation of the king: 45...gx£5 46 gxf5 Bb3 47 4xh7 (47 4g5 Bb5 is roughly the same as 45 h5) 47...Bg3 with a draw. 45 h5 is more interesting: 45...gx£5 46 gxf5 Sa5 (the c5- square has to be guarded) 47 Jlf6+ (after 47 4h6 fla4 48 J,c5+ 4f6 49 4xh7 d4 it is White who has to try and draw) 47..:4e8 48 jtg7 4e7 (a natural move, but 48...d4! is technically more accurate, since after 49 Jtxd4 the rook will keep the £5-pawn under fire, and White will be unable to win, even after pene¬ trating with his king to f6) 49 Jtd4 Bb5 50 4h6 (the optimal moment for the attack on 327 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors the h7-pawn) 50...flb3 51 ^?xh7 Bg3! (not 51.. .flB? 52 ±c5+ <A’f6 53 A-g8!) 52 h6 (the difference compared with the 45 <i>h6 varia- tion is that the h-pawn is more advanced, but this is not decisive) 52...fig5 53 Jtg7 d4 54 £6+ <4>xe6 55 <4>g8 d3 56 f7 lf5 57 h7 d2 58 h8# dlW 59 *d7 60 JLf6 ®g4+ 61 Wg7 ®c4, and the draw, evidently, cannot be avoided.

Bbl 47 h6! gxh6 48 £6 and wins) 41 f5 Bxb3+ 42 *f4 Hxb4 43 e6+ <4>g8 44 <4>e5 h6 45 <4>xd5 Ha4! (after 45...Hb8? 46 ±c5 Bd8+ 47 <4>c6 the king gives decisive support to the immi¬ nent pawn breakthrough: 47...Hdl 48 JLd6 Hal 49 <4>d7 Ha7+ 50 1x7 Ha8 51 g5! hxg5 52 h6 g4 53 hxg7 <4)xg7 54 1x5+ etc.), and if 46 g5 hxg5 47 h6 gxh6 48 f6, then, ‘in the opinion’ of the computer, Black forces a draw by 48...Hxd4+! 49 <4>xd4 g4 50 <4+5 g3 51 f7+ <S?g7 52 <4>d6 g2 53 <4>e7 gl# 54 f8W+ <4)h7. In a practical game, of course, a number of accurate moves would still be demanded of Black in this final position. It stands to reason that this fascinating endgame contains many more subtleties. But in any case there is no doubt that 32..JSf8? was a decisive mistake by Korchnoi, allowing White to take the game into a purely technical stage. 33 a4! Karpov breaks up the opponent’s pawn pair, condemning Black’s rooks to the defence of his weak pawn islands. 33.. .bxa4 34 bxa4 g6 35 2xa5 2ee8 35...h5 can now be disregarded by White: 36 Hc5! hxg4 37 a5 Hd8 38 <4>xg4 Hd5 39 Hxd5 cxd5 40 <4>x£3 and wins. 36 2a7 (this effectively concludes the game) 36.. .2f7 White need not fear the exchange 36..JSa8 37 a5 flxa7 38 l.xa7: too many of his pawns dream of becoming a queen. 37 2a6!

The three pawns for the exchange, plus active pieces, do not leave the opponent any chances of saving the game, especially after adjournment analysis. On the day for adjournments, first the chal¬ lenger unexpectedly lost the 13th game (see above). ‘Korchnoi was shocked,’ Karpov re¬ calls. ‘After all, within half an hour he faced a second resumption — and a second successive defeat... I thought that he wouldn’t turn up for this resumption, but he arrived, probably in order to demonstrate that he could calmly accept this blow of fate. He even smiled. I can imagine what this smile must have cost him.’ 42...gxh5 43 c4 2a2 44 Sb6 *f7 45 c5 2a4 46 c6 *e6 47 c7 *d7 48 2b8 2c8 49 *e3! 2xh4 50 e6+! 1-0 Black resigned: 50...<4>xd6 51 flxc8 flc4 52 2d8+! <4)xc7 53 e7 or 50...45x6 51 JLg3! The score became 3-1 in the champion’s favour. And he decided to ‘let his rearguard catch up’ and accustom himself to the new situation in the match: ‘I did not force events, but continued playing as though nothing had happened, confident that the rising wave in 328 Anatoly the Twelfth me would sweep away the opponent with its logical strength. Which is what happened in the 17th game.5 To be fair, it should be mentioned that at the very start of this incredibly dramatic and entertaining game Korchnoi lost 11 minutes on his clock in the battle with Zukhar (cf. p.121) and then achieved a completely won position by energetic play. And that evening the "rising wave’ could have covered Karpov himself "with its logical strength’... Before analysing this game let us try to un¬ derstand what the Doctor of Medical Sciences Vladimir Petrovich Zukhar was doing in Ba¬ guio. After all, initially his task was merely to ensure that Karpov slept well and to give him psychological advice. Alexander Roshal recalls: "Korchnoi has always been noted for his mistrustfulness, and he believed in parapsy¬ chology and all kinds of mysticism (later he even played a game with... Marocz/s spirit). From the very start in Baguio, when Zukhar had not yet begun to enjoy himself, Viktor Lvovich complained: £"They’ve brought a se¬ cret psychologist with them!” He must have remembered Zukhar from the Moscow match. In short, as soon as Korchnoi gave grounds for thinking that he was afraid of hypnosis, this was immediately exploited. We knew perfectly well that Zukhar was no hyp¬ notist, but we decided: if that’s what the op¬ ponent wants, by all means! And the doctor himself became so carried away by his role, that he soon began to regard himself as virtu¬ ally the main participant in the events. Before the games he did not have soup and did not drink water, so that he could then sit continu¬ ously for the full five hours at his ""battle sta¬ tion” on the 4th row. I don’t know exactly whether this was on Baturinsky’s instructions or his own initiative. "The ways that the challenger’s team tried to combat our psychologist! Petra Leeuwerik sat herself directly in front of him, blocking his vision. Then Zukhar began asking us, Kry¬ lov or the ""art critics in civilian clothes” (KGB officials — G.K) to move Petra somewhere. Once she sat almost in his lap and Tal imme¬ diately commented: ""Now he is Vladimir Pet¬ rovich!” "Psychologists are strange people: when they are constantly talked about, they begin to be¬ lieve in the exclusive importance of their mis¬ sion. During one of the lengthy time-outs we were all invited to another reception, and a lo¬ cal compere announced: ‘"Among our guests is Anatoly Karpov’s team. Present here with them is the famous...” He was probably intending to name Tal, who was well known even in the Philippines. But here, not allowing him to fin¬ ish, Zukhar suddenly stood up and bowed... "Some time later from Korchnoi’s camp they announced: ""Well, just you wait: soon a person will arrive, and he’ll hypnotise every¬ one.” However, it did not prove very difficult for the Soviets to disarm our emigrant from Kharkov, this amateur ""hypnotist”, who, clearly, would undertake any work... This was a psychological war. Initially we regarded it as a rather amusing game. I, for example, permit¬ ted myself a dubious joke about this ""little Jew”. But then these games acquired more threatening dimensions.’ ...So, after winning the fierce battle to have Zukhar moved, the challenger finally made his first move, and promptly the champion emerged from his rest room.

Korchnoi called this new, sharp move "an interesting idea of Yacob Murey’. Usually 6 4if3 or 6 was played. 6...b5!? Black replies as in the 7th game, where "this 329 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors pawn sacrifice came as a surprise and proved fully justified from the practical point of view.’ (Karpov) 7 dxe6 fxe6 (in Karpov’s opinion, 7...bxc4 8 exf7+ sbh.8 9 lxc4 d5 is even better) 8 cxb5 a6!? And this is a novelty. Apparently the champion was dissatisfied with the outcome of the opening in the 7th game, where he first set up a mobile pawn centre: 8...1b7 9 ^f3 d5 10 0-0 <£>bd7 11 ^e2! #e8 12 <£>g3 e5 (12...c4l? 13 lc2 thcS) 13 lf5 g6 14 lh3 a6?! 15 £ig5! axb5 (if 15...1a5 or 15...®e7, then 16 e4! is strong) 16 <S^e6 c4 17 ld2l, and White won the exchange, but., not the game. 9£ie2d5 10 0-0e5 10...axb5 11 lxb5 la6 12 lxa6 (Sla6 was possibly more promising, but as a matter of principle Karpov does not want for the mo¬ ment to determine the position of his bishop. 11 a3 The first critical moment. 11.. .axb5?! cIt was better to choose between ll...la5 and ll...lxc3.’ (Tal).

It sometimes happens that in analysis you come to one conclusion, but during a game you begin to have doubts, and new variations creep into your mind. You change the planned course, and afterwards you reproach yourself: What have I done?’ That was the case here: it was recommended to Karpov that he should retain the bishop, but thinking at the board led him in a different direction. Why? £If 12...1e6 there is the unpleasant reply 13 <S^a4, while 12...c4 does not work in view of 13 e4, and Black’s position collapses. In the event of 12...1a5 (Tal) White plays 13 ld2, creating the threat of b2-b4, after which the opening of the a-file is now in favour of White’ (Karpov). For example: 13...1a6 14 b4! cxb4 15 axb4 lxb4 16 fh3 1x5 17 Sfdl or 17 Sfcl, and Black’s hanging centre is on the point of collapse. As for 12...®b6, Karpov rejected this be¬ cause of 13 ld3 c4? 14 £)xd5, although after 13...1xc3 14 ^xc3 le6! Black would have gained compensation for the pawn, while 14 bxc3 would not have been so favourable for White as in the game.

Analysis diagram 330 Anatoly the Twelfth And here, instead of the pretty variation given by Karpov — 18 £ic3 JLxc3 19 bxc3 ±xg2! 20 *xg2 Ig8+ or 18 a4 #c6 19 G Jtb6 and wins, there is 18 b4!, sharply chang¬ ing the evaluation of the position: 18...1Sc6? 19 G Jtb6 does not work because of 20 b5!, while in the event of 18...cxb4 19 axb4 Jtxg2 20 Wc5!

Karpov does not like pawn defects and so, even in calculations ‘for his opponent’, he clearly underestimated this capture with the pawn. Now Black’s pawn trio loses its mobil¬ ity and he has to seek some other compensa¬ tion for the sacrificed pawn. But this is not easy, since he has no lead in development and the bishop at b5 paralyses his counterplay on the queenside. 13..,ika6?! Black agrees to the exchange of the light- squared bishops, reckoning that White’s other bishop will be cramped and that it will some¬ how be possible to exploit this. £13...

Black would have had to reckon with 15 Jtc6!? 15 c4 d4 16 £>g3! The immediate 16 f4 looked tempting. Af¬ ter this Karpov was intending to reply 16.. .^c6, not seeing that after 17 fxe5 4hi:e5 18 exd4 ?\xe4 19 ®d3! Black would stand badly: 19...£>e5 20 Af4 £ixd3 21 ±xd6 Ifc8 22 a4 c4 23 ?^c3 etc. £16...ilb7 probably came into consideration’, although this too favours White: 17 £xe5 ®xe5 18 ^g3 ®c6 (18...dxe3 19lb3) 19 Aa4! etc. There only remains 16,..d3! According to Karpov, after 17 4ig3 exf4 (? — G.K) 18 Sxf4 White has some advantage’. But in my opin¬ ion he has practically a winning position: 18.. .fld8 19 £rf5! #e6 20 J,xa6 ^xa6 21 £kg71, or 18..Jtxb5 19 Ixb5 £>c6 (19...g6 20 Ib3) 20 etc. Of course, 17...e4 is essen¬ tial. Or 17 5lc3 e4, and if 18 g4, then 18...c4! with a complicated game. 16.. .£>c6 17 a4! After the £greedy’ 17 #e6 18 Axc6 Wx£5 19 e4! (19 JLxa8? ®xbl Karpov) 1 9..Mc6\ 20 J.xa8 Ixa8 and 21...±xc4 Black’s pair of connected passed pawns could well have compensated for the exchange defi¬ cit 17.. .£ia5? A significant loss of time. The planned play against the c4-pawn does not succeed. Possi¬ bly the bishop should have been withdrawn — 33 1 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors \l„.Abl? (Karpov). This too would not have promised Black an easy life, but at any event some playing intrigue would have been re¬ tained. 18 #d3 We6 19 exd4! cxd4 (19...exd4 20 Aa3 or 19..JLxb5 20 cxb5 exd4 21 Jtg5 is also unsatisfactory) 20 c5 2fc8 21 f4! This destroys Black’s hopes for his central pawns. Now White adds a powerful initiative to his material advantage. 21 ...2xc5 It is obvious that I have lost the strategic battle. All that remains is to rely on my re¬ sourcefulness in defence and to seek tactical chances.’ (Karpov) 22 Axa6\ The shortest way, although White would also have gained a decisive advantage after 22 fxe5 Jtxb5 (22...Sxe5? 23 Jtxa6 and Hb8+) 23 axb5 Sxe5 24 Wxd4 (24 b6 Karpov) 24...Bd5 25 ®f4 or 23...1fxe5 24 £>f5!

To his misfortune, Korchnoi decided to play not for an attack, but for a technically won endgame. After 23 Hb8+! ‘if7 24 flb5! with the threat of fxe5 Black would have had no defence: 24...exf4 25 £>e4 flc6 26 ^xf6 2xf6 27 fbdi7 £>c6 28 flf5!, or 24...flc3 25 Wf5 5xg3 (what else?) 26 fxe5! fig6 27 exf6 gxf6 (27...2xf6 28 #d7+) 28 lg5!, paralysing the opponent’s army. 23.. .5xa6 24 la3 (this bishop, which has no opponent, is destined to play an enormous role in the course of the subsequent batde) 24.. .2d5 25 £\f5! if7 Black would hardly have had any more hopes after 25...4}c6 26 fxe5 Hxe5 27 JSb7, and if 27..JSa7, then 28 Bb6!, for example: 28.. .£ld8 (28...fie6 or 28...flxa4 - 29 ld6!) 29 2b8 2d7 30 £>xd4! flxd4 31 lb2 Sed5 32 lxd4 flxd4 33 a5 if7 34 a6 fid7 35 a7 Hxa7 36 Hxd8 and wins. 26 fxe5 2xe5 27 2b5 The pawn capture 27 ^xd4 would have led to a lessening of the tension and a drawn outcome after 27...^c4.’ (Karpov). However, after 28 Ub7+! no draw is apparent: 28...ig6 29 lf8 £le8 30 Hb4, or 28...ie8 29 lb4 flxa4 30 ^f5 id8 31 lc3 and flxg7 with an extra pawn and the initiative, while if 28...ig8, then 29 le7 Hxa4 30 lxf6 gxf6 31 ^f5 ^d2 32 Sell, and the £7th rank absolute’ (Nimzowitsch) is bound to win for White. 27.. .£ic4!? ‘In his preliminary calculations Korchnoi overlooked this move. Of course. White was hoping for the exchange of rooks’ (Karpov): 27.. JSxb5 28 axb5 Sa8(e6) 29 ^xd4 and wins. 27..

Time-trouble moves can be criticised only for the sake of establishing the truth. The flamboyant 30 Af8!? <4>xd4 31 Axg7 looks risky, although White regains with interest the temporary piece sacrifice: 31...Hee6 32 Hf7 *e5 33 g4! Hxa4 34 g5, or 31...&d5 32 Hdl+! <4?e4 33 AxeS, winning the h-pawn and retain¬ ing the a-pawn. On the other hand, the accurate 30 4tk2 Hxa4 31 Af8! would have allowed White to convert his advantage without particular risk: 31.. .^e8 32 ^b4+! 4^4 33 4k;6! with a deci¬ sive attack, or 31...He8 32 Axg7 £}e4 (32...<4>c6 33 lb4!

Korchnoi aims to leave Black without any pawns, hoping that his rook and pair of knights will be unable to cope with White’s passed pawns, supported by his active rooks. He does not yet see any danger for himself, otherwise he would first have played 33 Hf4+!, driving back the black king, and only after 33.. .4>d5(c5) — 34 Hxg7 with chances of suc¬ cess. 33.. .6C4 34 Hf4+ ^e4!? cTo all appearances, Black could have gained a draw even after 34...<S?d3, but then 35 Hf7, and in the end the h-pawn has to be ex- 333 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors changed for the a-pawn. It was better to do this immediately, but on the other hand an¬ other piece is activated/ (Karpov) I think that if 34...(id3, then 35 h3! is stronger, for the moment not giving up the a- pawn: 35...^e3?! 36 a5! £}fd5 37 2a4, or 35.. .£id5 36 fld7! £ie3 37 *£2, and the draw is still a long way off. 35 fld7+!

How could White not take the pawn, with his flag about to fall? But 37 Be7! ^icd2 38 Sa3 was much stronger, with the intention of a4-a5 and h2-h3. Black, deprived of counter¬ play (38...Hc6 39 Sal! or 38..JSa5 39 Sa2!), would have had to try and save his h-pawn and conduct a difficult struggle for a draw. 37.. .£icd2?! (again risking a practical chance in the opponent's time-trouble, instead of the simple 37...flxa4 with equality) 38 Ba3?! (the cool-headed 38 Hff7! fixa4 — not 38...Bc6? 39 h4! — 39 Sa7 Sc4 40 Bal would again have forced Black to fight for a draw) 38...Bc6! 39 Hal?? 39 h4?? was also suicidal: 39...fial+ 40 *t?h2 £tfl+ 41 <i)h3 ^f2 mate.

White resigned: 40 gxf3 Bg6+ 41 <S?hl £}f2 mate, or 40 Aftl mate. Thunderous applause broke out in the hall: some Soviet tourists had arrived for that week. Karpov: ‘My two knights mated the enemy king in the endgame — such a thing had never before happened in a match for the world championship! After signing the score-sheet, Korchnoi went up to the demonstration board and stared at it for several minutes, as if trying to comprehend what exactly had happened.' After this shock the challenger travelled to Manila, and took two time-outs, one after an¬ other. Karpov: To be frank, I suspect that Korchnoi was endeavouring not to have to play in the presence of the Soviet tourists (someone even reported his words to me: “I will not afford them this pleasure any more.”) The administration of the Terrace Plaza Hotel arranged a celebration to mark my fourth win. I had to eat the white king, made out of cream, from a cake with four candles at the corners of a “tasty” chessboard, depicting the final position from the 17th game.' That same evening, 26th August, the birth¬ day of Roshal, the Soviet delegation's press attache, was also celebrated, and Edmondson, a ‘neutral' member of the jury, made a toast: We live in a divided world: continents drift apart, religions clash, families break up... But chess, by contrast, unites us and joins sepa¬ rated continents together. To those who serve it! To you, dear Alex!' A quarter of a century later Roshal was to say: ‘Alas, like many of my colleagues, I cannot completely agree with this compliment or consider myself a “dove of peace”. War is war...' 334 Anatoly the Twelfth Soon a report arrived from Manila: Korchnoi was demanding the removal of the Soviet psychologist from the stalls and the installation of a glass screen between the audi¬ torium and the stage, otherwise he would re¬ fuse to continue. The match was on the verge of collapse. Baturinsky recalls that the same evening Karpov said to him: 1 must win the match, play it out to the end, despite all of Korchnoi’s tricks. Think up an acceptable form of compromise, which would meet this aim.’ This was how the well-known Batunn- sky-Keene ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ arose, and after a week’s break the match was renewed. Baturinsky: The period between the 18th and 26th games can safely be called the days of Karpov’s missed opportunities. He lost the 21 st game and did not score a single win, al¬ though he was close to victory in the 18th, 20th, 22nd and 25th — and he could easily have concluded the match, even if he had only won two of them. In almost every one of these games the world champion committed the same stereotyped mistake: after achieving a great advantage by excellent play and with a sufficient reserve of time, he displayed inexpli¬ cable haste and wasted all his chances. For example, in the 22nd game it would have been simplest for him to seal 41 flxd6 — Tal thinks that Black would have resigned without re¬ suming. But Karpov made this move on the board and continued playing rapidly, when the game was adjourned seven moves later there was no longer a win. In such cases the cham¬ pion’s trainers and friends in the auditorium wanted to shout: ‘Tolya, stop!” Alas, this was not possible... Karpov explains such “slips” by his childhood habit of playing quickly. On growing up, he tried to rid himself of it, but he has not always succeeded. It would seem that there is also another reason: at moments of greatest tension, unavoidable when playing at such a level, one’s inhibiting reflexes some¬ times do not work.’ After the 22nd game Karpov was especially upset: Why didn’t I stop immediately after the time control? But I got wound up: he moves — I move, he moves — I move... When I came to, my net was empty. That’s when I found myself unable to sleep! And for the first time in the match I turned to Zukhar for help. It is not defeats that not distress you, so much as missed opportunities... I was in torment for half the night and then I summoned Zukhar. He tried his sorcery on me — in vain. The next day I walked about like a zombie, and that night I did not tempt fate, but asked Zukhar to immediately get down to business. And again all to no purpose. And pills were taboo for me — chess does not condone them... I racked my brains and still couldn’t understand: why, why, why couldn’t I exploit my obvious playing advantage?!’ Although the champion won the 27th game and the score now became 5-2, this did not improve his condition. ‘Everything that could bum in me had already burned out... There remained only one, last step, but I did not know, I did not imagine, at that moment I did not see how to make it.’ And here the real drama began for Karpov: he lost the 28th and 29th games and, after a draw in the 30th, also the 31st (this psycho¬ logical fatigue is very familiar to me, piling up when the goal is very close: in our 1986 return match, when also leading ‘plus three’, I con¬ trived to lose three games in a row). To the astonishment of the entire chess world, the score became 5-5. What happened just before the decisive 32nd game is described in the chapter ‘Baguio through the Eyes of Korchnoi’. Karpov: T)o you know what distinguishes a competitor from a non-competitor? If a non¬ competitor loses successive games, he goes to pieces and gives up, whereas a competitor continues moving forward, because he knows that the bad run will somewhere come to an end, and things will improve. I sensed that Korchnoi’s wave had already passed, and that mine was again beginning to rise.... On an¬ other occasion after such a trip (to Manila, dur- 335 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ing the time-out - G.K) I would have been dead tired, but here it was as though I had bathed in the water of life. For the 32nd game I arrived calm and confident. Korchnoi barely looked at me — and that was enough. When week after week you see one and the same person in front of you, you can guess his condition and mood from the first glance. And Korchnoi realised everything; even earlier than me he realised that this game would be the last. I read this in his momentary glance, after which he immediately looked away. I conducted this game in the way that I would always like to play: calmly, without emotions, easily and naturally.5 Unfortunately, the media coverage of the historic 32nd game was amazingly superficial and one-sided. Apparently it was affected by the enormous political importance of its re¬ sult, and also the extraordinarily nervous match situation and the extreme fatigue of all the participants in this event, including the commentators. I hope that I have succeeded in filling the resulting gap. Game 77 A.Karpov-V.Korchnoi World Championship Match, Baguio 1978, 32nd game Schmid Benoni A.43 1 e4 d6 2 d4 £>f6 3 ®c3 g6 4 ®f3 ±g7 5 ±e2 0-0 6 0-0 c5 A rare move. "Korchnoi is faithful to his fa¬ vourite tactics — of changing the opening pat¬ terns as often as possible.5 (Karpov). The 18th game went 6...itg4 7 Jte3 <£\c6 (cf. Game No.73). The choice of opening at the finish of a lengthy match, especially with Black, is not an easy matter. Your nerves are already frayed, and everything that you have played earlier seems full of flaws. You want something new, but at the same time also solid and slightly puzzling. According to grandmaster Panno, who helped Korchnoi in this match, they wanted "to choose something rather compli¬ cated, especially taking account of the cham¬ pion’s psychological condition.’ One can only guess who convinced him to play 6...c5 (al¬ though it is known that Keene and Torre had played in similar vein). But the choice proved unfortunate for Korchnoi, and they also guessed wrong about Karpov’s psychological condition. 7 d5 Instantly taking play from a Pirc-Ufimtsev Defence into a well known Indian set-up: the so-called Schmid-Tal Benoni, which had al¬ ready occurred in Karpov’s games. It is amus¬ ing that the first "mainstay’ of the variation was the chief arbiter at the match (true, by that time he had left Baguio) and the second was one of the champion’s helpers... Korchnoi was expecting 7 dxc5 dxc5 8 ttxd8 Hxd8 9 Jte3 b6 10 flfdl, since theory judged this variation to be slightly favourable for White. Karpov: "But I realised that the opponent could have prepared an improve¬ ment, and I avoided the exchange of pawns.’ Indeed, soon after the match one of Korchnoi’s seconds demonstrated a new move, which solved Black’s opening prob¬ lems: 10...4^c6! 11 Hxd8+ ^xd8 12 Hdl JLb7 (Andersson-Stean, Munich 1979). Korchnoi was shocked: "I had analysed this move for many days, counting on the psycho¬ logical effect of its novelty. Great was my sur¬ prise when at the critical moment Karpov 336 Anatoly the Twelfth replied without thinking. He knew the move 6.. .c5 (is this really so surprising for a top-class grandmaster? — G.K) and moreover — he was expecting its appearance on that very day!’ Once again one has to give Karpov’s psy¬ chological insight its due. 7.. .^a6 The most popular continuation. The alter¬ native strategy involves the immediate under¬ mining of the centre — 7...e6. 8 Af4 This move, inhibiting ...e7-e6, is now deemed the strongest, but at that time they often played both 8 h3 and 8 (Volume 4, GameNo.21). 8.. .^c7 9 a4 Useful prophylaxis. If 9 £ld2, then 9...b5P! 10 4^xb5 is questionable (Najdorf-Tal, Mos¬ cow 1967), but 9...4M7 is acceptable.

In the event of 9.. Ag4 10 h3 ±xf3 11 ±xf3 £ld7 12 #d2 a6 13 JLe2 White has a slight but enduring ad- vantage (Karpov-Browne, Madrid 1973). 9...a6!? is sharper — this possibly does not give Black full equality, but here he at least acquires some counter-chances. For example, in the game Tal-Velimirovic (Belgrade 1979) after 10 Bel (currently 10 ®ti2 or 10 h3 is in fashion, but not 10 a5 ^b5!) 10...flb8 11 a5 (11 e5 £ih5 is also unclear) ll...b5 12 axb6 Bxb6 Black created piece play compensating for the weakening of his queenside. To judge by the further course of the game, Korchnoi did not in fact come to his senses after the opponent’s forceful reaction to his preparation. Thoughts crept in about traitors and spies, and in addition, in violation of all that had been agreed, in the 4th row of the auditorium the 'terrible’ Dr Zukhar again ap¬ peared and fixed him with his penetrating stare. The challenger’s playing mood was clearly spoiled and he began deploying the pieces T>y hand’, without any clear-cut plan. And a few moves later he committed an im¬ perceptible, but serious mistake... 10 Bel Ab7 After 10...a6 White could have played 11 h3 and carried out the same arrangement of his forces as in the game: 11...4M7 (ll...Bb8? 12 e5!) 12 Ac4 Bb8 13 Wd3 (Khalifman- Ermenkov, Burgas 1994), or ll..JLb7 12 JLc4 Wd7 13 Wd3 (cf. the following note). 11 £c4! An unpleasant nuance: White immediately supports his centre, saving a tempo on h2-h3. The prophylactic 11 h3, with the idea of maintaining the bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal, could have proved to be a delay after 1 l...Wd7 12 Ac4 fiad8 13 Wd3 e5 (or 13...e6 - G.K), initiating double-edged play.’ (Karpov) However, practice has made certain correc¬ tions to this evaluation: 13 £ib5! a6 14 £ixc7 Wxcl 15 #e2 WcS 16 Badl Sfe8 17 c3, and Black is still without counterplay (Hort- Seppeur, Bundesliga 1984). Therefore at the end of the 20th century the main debates revolved around 12...a6 13 tt’d3! (it is too early for 13 e5?! £ih5 Sosonko- Torre, Amsterdam 1977; Beliavsky-Torre, Moscow 1981) 13...Sad8 14 Badl WcS 15 We3 Bfe8, and if 16 Ah6, then 16...e6! (Piket- Gheorghiu, Ostend 1987; Adianto-Torre, San Francisco 1991; Yusupov-Ljubojevic, Linares 337 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 1992), but in the 21st century they began play¬ ing 16 fld2! and Hedl, maintaining the threat of a bind. The absence of h2-h3 induces Black to drive away the bishop at f4 from the key e5- square. 11.. .£>h5 "A loss of precious time.

Alas, after 16 Jlg3 Jid4 17 We2 with the threat of ‘SMI the computer coldly ascertains that the complica¬ tions quickly come to an end: 17...S)lx£2 18 £M>5!, or 17...1rxf2+ 18 ±x£2 fixf2 19 <4>hl flxe2 20 Sxe2 S)lf2+ 21 Bxf2 Jlxf2 22 d6+, and White wins.

Black’s position is also not improved by 11.. .5.7 12 #d2 etc. Therefore, in contrast to Korchnoi’s next move, the criticism of 11.. .‘SMS seems unfounded. 12 Ag5 Stf6? cIt seems to me that on this occasion Korchnoi’s predilection for solid positions served him badly,’ writes Karpov... in his note to 11...SM5. But the faultiness of Black’s 12th move was remarked on neither by the winner himself, nor by Tal in <54, nor by Filip in Infor- mator„ nor by many other commentators! 12...h6 was necessary, for example: 13 Ah4 g5 14 Stid2 SM4 15 Ag3 S^g6 16 a6, or 13 Jte3 e6! 14 Wd2 exd5 15 exd5 g5, enlivening the position at the cost of weakening the kingside. This obligatory method of defence occurred in practice at the end of the 20th century. 13 Wd3 "Now in all directions it is much harder for Black to gain play.’ (Karpov). Or more accu¬ rately — now Black is on the verge of defeat! 13.. .a6 14 Badl Bb8 15 h3?! Ultra-safe play. "I didn’t want to take a risk at this moment,’ writes Karpov.

But all this is irrelevant, since instead of 32.. Jle8 it is better to play 32..

The following day Keene informed the arbiter Filip that Black was re¬ signing the game without resuming. By winning this unforgettable match by a score of 6-5 (with 21 draws), Karpov retained his title of world champion. But what would have happened in the event of him losing? Ten years later, already in the era of perestroika and glasnost, Mikhail Tal, ap¬ pearing on television, was to say with a smile: "We could not imagine the consequences if an anti-Soviet player, not a Soviet, had become world champion. It is possible that then chess would have been declared a pseudo-science/ Later he bumped into Korchnoi at the Olym¬ piad in Novi Sad (1990), and in reply to re¬ proaches 'regarding the behaviour of the Sovi¬ ets’ he suddenly said to him in an apologetic tone: There, in Baguio, we were all afraid for you — if you had won the match, you could have been physically eliminated. Everything had been prepared for this ...’ And Korchnoi seizes on this version in his most recent interviews: £I did not deliberately lose the match in Baguio, but if I had won it, everything had been prepared for my elimina¬ tion! In bis time, Roshal apparently signed an obligation to “keep secret for ever”, but Tal, who did not sign anything, tokl me about this directly to my face! I repeat: I did not deliber¬ ately lose this match. But some higher forces did not allow me to win it.’ But this is how Alexander Roshal com¬ mented on this conflict in autumn 2005: Throughout my long life in chess I have not met one single top player who was not 340 Anatoly the Twelfth wary and suspicious. Not one! These traits — wariness and suspicion, produced by constant rivalry, help to preserve opening secrets, and induce you to be friendly only with those who are not dangerous, who will not betray you, not inflict psychological trauma, and so on. The suspiciousness of other great players reached hypochondriac, and sometimes even manic proportions. £I remember how in the summer of 1974, not long before the first Karpov-Korchnoi match, after arriving at the Olympiad in Nice I entered the enormous playing hall together with Korchnoi’s wife Bella. Karpov was sitting a long way from us, on a platform, and later he suddenly asked me: “What were you talking about for 35 minutes with Korchnoi’s wife?” Just think: during a game, at a distance of a hundred metres from us, he noted the time of our conversation! He needed to be sure of whether I was with him or with Korchnoi. But I was on good terms with both of them (and quite recently Viktor presented me with a copy of his book with the inscription: To my friend-cum-enemy7). ‘Korchnoi suffered even more from suspi¬ ciousness. Once Tal said jokingly to me: “You have a persecution mania, which periodically turns into megalomania and back again.” But, in my opinion, something similar used to hap¬ pen with Korchnoi. This was a continuous process: he lost — oh, oh, I have been be¬ trayed, there are spies all around; he won — I am indeed the greatest! ‘On learning from Tal about their meeting in Novi Sad and that in Baguio we were sup¬ posedly afraid for Korchnoi’s life, I was an¬ noyed: “Misha, why did you have to make a joke like that with him} Do you know who you are joking with?” Tal replied: “So what — now it is probably pleasant for him to hear this.’ But you have to know Korchnoi: any joke that concerns him, he takes seriously! And, being mistrustful and inclined towards mysticism, he is always looking for a needle in a haystack - when it isn’t there. To judge by his interview, Viktor obviously overestimates how informed I was about non¬ chess questions: I didn’t know anything about a threat to his life! And I reject all the rumours about “preparations for his elimination in Ba¬ guio” as being absurd and far from the truth. The reality was this: in the event of Karpov losing, a return match would have taken place within a year, and the Soviet Union would have made every effort to ensure that Tolya regained the chess crown for the country. ‘And besides, why should we have been afraid for Korchnoi?! Rather we should have been afraid for ourselves! When the score be¬ came 5-5,1 went down with high blood pres¬ sure, and Zukhar, Balashov and Zaitsev came to my room. The psychologist said: “I am now going to count to seventeen — when you wake up, all will be well.” He counted so tediously and unpleasantly, that I did indeed become drowsy. Then I asked: “Has Zukhar gone?” The trainers said: “He’s gone. But don’t worry — we have something prepared.” And I replied to them: “With your preparations we’ll most likely end up felling trees.” I knew about this not just by hearsay. I remember how similar black jokes were also cracked by the experi¬ enced Baturinsky. But, fortunately, Tolya won.’ The black jokes’ of Roshal and Baturinsky require an explanation: in Stalinist times the parents of the former were subjected to re¬ pression, while the latter served as a military procurator for many years, and retired holding the rank of colonel of justice. Also of great interest, but from the purely chess point of view, are the exclusive com¬ ments of Igor Zaitsev. *1 have heard the most varied stories about the 32nd game, some of them quite fantastic. As an eye-witness, who sat through the entire match in the auditorium, I should also like to express my opinion. ‘I will begin a long way back. It seems to me that Korchnoi derived a great benefit from his defeat against Spassky in the final Candi- 341 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors dates match in 1968. I don’t know how and on what he began working at that time, but from a certain moment his play became more dynamic, and his strategic ideas became more complete and polished. It was the strategic component that became the leading feature of Korchnoi’s play. Therefore, in contrast to other contenders for the crown, he could eas¬ ily replace one opening with another — despite his considerable age! The point is that, as they grow older, the overwhelming majority of players become strongly accustomed to the central structure typical of each opening, and to switch from one structure to another be¬ comes painful... 4In view of this, one could always expect Korchnoi to employ variations where the proc¬ ess of forming the pawn structure is varied and stretched out over a period of time. For exam¬ ple, this happens in the English Opening (one of Korchnoi’s most effective opening weapons) or the Alekhine Defence (which was also in his arsenal at one time). Also in keeping with these set-ups is the flexible Pirc-Ufimtsev Defence. Therefore Korchnoi’s decision to choose this particular opening at the most important mo¬ ment in the match is not something that I con¬ sider “sensational” or “short-sighted”, but rather fully expected and in accordance with his chess portrait ‘Firstly, Korchnoi had already played this defence twice against Karpov — at the Inter¬ zonal tournament in Leningrad (1973) and in the 18th game of the match in Baguio, and both times it had all turned out well for Black. Secondly, Keene, the challenger’s second, had also played this against Karpov — at the Euro¬ pean Team Championship in Moscow (1977), and although he lost, he was nevertheless able to provoke double-edged complications. And this could have drawn the attention of Korchnoi, who at the finish was aiming to build on his success. Besides, the manner in which Karpov plays this opening — one and the same solid, unhurried set-up — apparently not only did not frighten Korchnoi, but, on the contrary, even to some extent suited him, as he had clearly summoned up his courage. An indirect confirmation of these conclusions is Karpov’s only loss in his triumphant 50th USSR Championship (1983), which he suf¬ fered with White against Azmaiparashvili pre¬ cisely in the Pirc-Ufimtsev Defence. ‘Of course, the Pirc with 6...c5 is rather dif¬ ferent, but, in view of its comparative novelty, such a reorientation could have proved both unexpected, and successful. Incidentally, this variation is by no means discredited in theory and later it was played by many well-known grandmasters, right up to Kramnik. And yet it has to be admitted that here the course of po¬ sitional pressurising for White is more in Kar¬ pov’s style, whereas Black’s latent preparation of this or that undermining of the enemy cen¬ tre is not fully in Korchnoi’s spirit. Therefore it is not surprising that in the 32nd game the situation on the board began quite soon to turn in our favour. However, right to the very last minutes of this dramatic encounter, our totally exhausted group did not believe that things would have a happy end. ‘However, the return flight was also far from cloudless — in the literal sense: almost all the way to Bombay we were followed closely by another typhoon. I remember how several times the aircraft plunged into a deep air pocket, inducing slight panic among the pas¬ sengers. But even so, this was nothing in comparison with that incredible relief that we all felt, when the burden of this ordeal was lifted from our shoulders.’ In my view, Karpov played this match dur¬ ing something of a slump, and so right up to the 17th game he did not have any playing ad¬ vantage over Korchnoi — moreover, objectively Korchnoi even played the more interesting chess. It was only after his tragic blunder in the 17th game that Korchnoi, as they say, ‘began to drift’, and he should have quickly lost the match. But Karpov did not win several won positions, and the match dragged out.. 342 Anatoly the Twelfth In the end, the result of the match showed that Korchnoi had too great an amplitude of oscillation between strong and weak moves. Karpov played, perhaps, not so colourfully, but he nevertheless made fewer mistakes. Generally speaking, the ‘Karpov problem’ consists precisely in this evenness of his play, his amazing ability to maintain a fairly high level quality of moves for a long time. Of course, he made blunders, but, in contrast to the blunders of his opponents, in the over¬ whelming majority of cases they were not fa¬ tal. This property, plus the champion’s excep¬ tional tenacity, enabled him also later to ‘stretch out’ the most difficult, sometimes hopeless matches. Baguio served as a warning signal for Kar¬ pov, forcing him to begin readjusting litde by litde. And from 1979 he began a period when he developed a new algorithm and steadily im¬ proved his play. Later, remembering his battles with Korchnoi, Karpov was to comment ‘Those were his best years, but I developed more quickly than he strengthened his play.’ Celestial Play In February 1979 Karpov started a strong tournament in Munich and was leading after five rounds (+2=3), but then he was forced to return home urgendy because of the death of his father. After this heavy blow he would probably have declined to participate in the forthcoming ‘Tournament of Stars’ (Montreal, April-May 1979), had he not agreed before¬ hand to play there, and had he not realised that if he dropped out it would ‘place under threat the very organisation of the event’. The double-round tournament of ten stars in Montreal, although ‘distinguished’ by the absence of the boycotted Korchnoi, assem¬ bled a field that was unique for those times: Karpov, Tal, Spassky and all the strongest non-Soviet players in the world. An ideal test for the champion! And after a short draw at the start with Hiibner he determinedly got down to business. Tal: ‘Chessplayers, as a rule, are unforgiving people, and for this reason the 2nd round clash between Karpov and Timman was ea¬ gerly awaited. After all, it was the Dutch grandmaster who had inflicted the last tour¬ nament defeat on the world champion (in Bugojno 1978 — G.K). It could be expected that Karpov would be out for revenge, and in this he succeeded brilliandy. The entire game was conducted by Karpov in one breath: he con¬ sistently restricted his opponent’s counterplay, and seized space inch by inch...’ Here it should be mentioned that Karpov’s special, exceptional refinement in the sphere of prophylaxis makes him close to Petrosian. Tn contrast to the majority of his colleagues, it would appear that from nature he was en¬ dowed with highly developed prophylactic thinking,’ thinks Mark Dvoretsky. ‘The fol¬ lowing game by Karpov (and to no lesser de¬ gree his commentary on it) vividly demon¬ strates the style of play and the way of think¬ ing of the then world champion. How much subtle work is concealed behind outward sim¬ plicity!’ Game 78 A.Karpov-J.Timman Montreal 1979,2nd round _Pirc-Ufimtsev Defence BO7_ 1 e4 d6 2 d4 $}f6 3 £ic3 g6 4 g3 Karpov usually played 4 and Jle2 (Game Nos. 73 and 77), but in this encounter with one of the acknowledged experts on this defence he wanted, in his own words, to ex¬ periment a litde, to try something new: ‘I played in accordance with my mood.’ 4...i.g7 5 i.g2 0-0 6 £ge2 Also a solid, but comparatively rare varia¬ tion. ‘Since the time that it came to promi¬ nence in chess theory, the Pirc-Ufimtsev De¬ fence has acquired the reputation of being a not altogether correct opening. And, in order to confirm this opinion, all kinds of attacking schemes for White were intensively devel- 343 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors oped. Years were required to get away from such an incorrect approach, but even now, through inertia, many unhurried strategic plans are still overshadowed.’ (Karpov) 6.. .e5 (another plan tried by Timman is 6.. .£>bd7 and ...c7-c5) 7 0-0 Soon after this game it also happened that I had to defend this position with Black: 7 h3 exd4 (7...b6!P or 7...4MxT7 and ...b7-b6 is inter¬ esting) 8 £W4 Se8 9 0-0 £ibd7 10 a4 a5 11 £Mb5 £>c5 12 AgS Ml 13 Wd2 h6! 14 jhf6 Jtxf6 15 2M5 JLxb5 16 axb5 (Geller- Kasparov, 47th USSR Championship, Minsk 1979), and here the simplest was 16...^xe4 with equality. 7.. Aa6 Not the best reply; 7...c6, 7...^c6 or 7.. .exd4 is much more usual. £As the middle- game approaches, and particularly in the mid- dlegame itself, the scattered state of Black’s forces will cause him much inconvenience. However, leading grandmasters (and Timman is certainly one of them) are obliged to have — and usually do have — their own opinion re¬ garding this or that book variation. This en¬ ables evaluations to be made more precise, and promotes the development of theory.’ 8 fiel c6 9 h3 ‘A typical prophylactic move in such situa¬ tions,’ explains Karpov. ‘White restricts the opponent’s bishop, and at the same time also creates a “no-go area” on the kingside for the remaining minor pieces.’ 9..J2e8 ‘All Black’s hopes of obtaining counterplay are associated with pressure on the e4-pawn.’ (Karpov). ‘But this is already prophylactic thinking,’ adds Dvoretsky. ‘Karpov immedi¬ ately determines the opponent’s main idea, for which he will carefully watch throughout the entire game.’ 10 Jtg5 Provoking ...h7-h6, in order then to play Wd2 with gain of tempo. Again a typical de¬ vice, which pursues the same aim — the accu¬ mulation of small advantages. Then all these imperceptible factors merge together to form that superiority of one set of pieces over an¬ other, which is customarily called a positional advantage.’ (Karpov). True, in the light of the following comment, the simple 10 Jte3!P comes into consideration. 10.. .h6?! After 10...exd4 11 ^xd4 h6 Karpov gives 12 Jtf4! g5 13 Jtcl (the weakness of the f5- square!), while if 10...Wb6!? — ‘simply 11 Hbl with advantage, since ll...exd4 12 ^xd4 2^c5 13 b4 4kxe4 is clearly unsatisfactory in view of 14 Jlxe4! £}xe4 15 <2W4 Jlxd4 16 2^f6+.’ Of course, 13...2^e6 is correct, and therefore I would have preferred 13 2^b3! <2}e6 14 Jte3 Wcl 15 ®d2 etc. But instead of 12...<2^5, T2...d5 is possible, or 12...^g4!P 13 hxg4 (13 ce2 %3f6l - G.K) 13..

(12 ^hxd4 ^c5 13 JLf4 ^h5!) 12...<Sic7 (not now 12.. .^c5?l on account of 13 e5!), ‘in the spirit of the game Sveshnikov-Tseshkovsky (Sochi 1976), although this also does not promise Black equality’ (Karpov) after 13 HM2 ^e6 14 Ae3 <&h7 15 g4. 12 ®d2 (Black has similar problems after 12...exd4 13 ^xd4 <4>h7 14 Sadi) 13 Sadi ±d7 It is unfavourable to play 13...exd4 14 JLxd4, when again 14...^c5? is not possible because of 15 e5! And ‘in the event of 13...±e6 14 g4 Sad8 15 f4 ±c4 16 ^g3 White has an equally promising position as in the game.’ (Karpov). In Dvoretsky’s opinion, here 16...exf4 17 Jtxf4 c5 deserves considera¬ tion. I think that after this White would have happily replied 18 d5. 14 g4! A typical move. Karpov’s commentary is instructive: ‘After some thought, I came to the conclusion that straightforward play in the centre would not get me anywhere. Now, with the aim of seizing fresh territory, the kingside pawns must be advanced. But I did not wish to play 14 f4 immediately. It would be illogical to increase the tension straight away — all the same White will subsequendy have to play g3- g4, so why not first utilise a resource for strengthening the position, such as g3-g4 and £}g3. At the same time White also solves an important strategic problem — he reinforces his e4-pawn.’ 14...Had8 15£ig3 ±c8 The advance f2-f4 can be radically pre¬ vented only by ...g6-g5, but Black’s position is not yet so bad for him to decide on such a desperate measure.’ 16 f4! b5?! Every grandmaster has his favourite moves, which he makes at the first opportunity. Timman liked to activate his game by advanc¬ ing his b-pawn, but here this merely weakens his position even more. However, it is hard to offer Black good advice: thus, in the event of 345 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 16.. .exf4 17 Ax£4 Wb6 18 b3 followed by fifl and jte3 he would also be threatened with death by suffocation. ‘Knowing Karpov’s style, it is very easy to guess his next move.’ (Dvoretsky) 17 a3! b4?! 18 axb4 £ixb4 (the only result of the desperate pawn advance is that now it is advantageous for White to go into practically any endgame) 19 £ice2! ‘Black’s idea was somehow to bring his pieces together, by playing ...a7-a5, ...Jta6, ...exd4 and ...c6-c5. But this is a lengthy proc¬ ess, and White succeeds in hindering his op¬ ponent’s plan.’ (Karpov) We would probably have been thinking about how to exploit as soon as possible White’s solid positional advantage — whether to play f4-f5, prepare g4-g5, and so on. But Karpov thinks quite differently: even in such situations he first of all monitors the oppo¬ nent’s possible intentions and tries to prevent them.’ (Dvoretsky) 19.. .exd4?! An admission that the battle has been lost. Black concedes the centre, after which he has nothing to hope for. But, according to Kar¬ pov, 19...a5 20 c3 or 19...c5 20 fxe5 dxe5 21 d5 was also hopeless. 20 £ixd4 a5 White’s subsequent play essentially reduces to preventing the opponent’s pieces from cominginto the game.’ (Karpov) 21 c3 £ia6 22 »c2! ‘Probably the best move of the game, which by and large is an excellent illustration of Nimzowitsch’s idea about the overprotec¬ tion of strategically important points. Here two forms of prophylaxis mentioned by Nim2owitsch are simultaneously combined — prevention of the opponent’s plans and over¬ protection.’ (Dvoretsky). White does not allow the black knight to come into play (22...4tk5 23 b4!) and he additionally supports his e4- pawn. 22.. .JLd7 23 4hf3! (again prophylaxis against ...£3c5) 23...He7 In Karpov’s opinion, ‘23...<5ic5 would not do because of 24 e5.’ Dvoretsky objects: ‘I don’t see how 24...4M5 is refuted — after 25 jtxc5 dxc5 it is not easy for White to demon¬ strate his advantage: 26 4^h5 (Adianto) 26.. .±h8 or 26 Wcl (Nunn) 26...c4 27 £ie4 f6 28 ?)d6 Hf8.’ However, after 26 ®e4! White’s position is clearly better (26...c4 27 fld2), al¬ though Black can still resist. And after 23...c5, in the words of Karpov, the knight at a6 would have the appearance of a living reproach. 24 ±f2! ‘One of the last prophylactic moves. Prior to his decisive offensive. White arranges his pieces in the most harmonious way possible and... once again reinforces his central e4- forepostl 24 ®d3 was premature in view of 24.. . jtc8,’ writes Karpov. He can hardly have considered cooperative variations such as 25 e5? £3d5 26 exd6? Bxd6 27 c4? Bxe3! 28 Bxe3 <S\xe3 29 ®xd6 ^xdl and wins (Nunn), but he guessed that Timm an wanted to play his bishop to e8, so he did not force .. Jbc8, but made a useful waiting move, strengthening the threat of e4-e5. 24.. .1.e8?! In the words of Karpov, ‘a tactical mistake’. But I think it will be agreed that somehow you would not want to play 24...Jtc8 voluntarily. 25 Wd3! *b7 (25...£to8? 26 e5 or 26 g5 and wins) 26 Hal! 346 Anatoly the Twelfth After lengthy manoeuvres in his half of the board. White again defers the start of the offensive, preferring to win material. 26.. .<£lc7 (here, and also a move later, ...Wxb2? is not possible because of Hebl) 27 Sxa5 Only the second crossing of the demarca¬ tion line (after 10 Ag5) has led to a completely won position for White: he is a pawn up and his pieces dominate, having squeezed the op¬ ponent’s main forces onto the last two ranks. 27.. .5dd7 28 b4^e6 29 Ae3! Karpov again does not hurry, intending also to drive the knight onto the back rank. He rejected 29 Wd2, since ‘after 29...d5!? Black have obtained something resembling counterplay: 30 e5 ^e4 31 ^xe4 dxe4 32 4?M4 c5, with complications.’ Here too there were no saving chances: 33 Jtxe4 Wb6 34 f5 or 33 bxc5 Wcl 34 Heal ^xcS 35 Hfe3, but... this was not enough for Karpov! 29.. .c5 30 f5 £}d8 31 b5 Not allowing the knight to go to c6. Tor “complete happiness” it only remains for White to play c3-c4, so as to achieve domina¬ tion over the whole board.’ (Karpov) 31.. .*h8 32 Af2 ‘The bishop has done its work at e3 and it again withdraws, to strengthen the e4-point.’ (Dvoretsky) 32.. .*c7 33 2a4 #b8 34 c4 Ba7 (there is no point in discussing 34...^g8 35 h4) 35 fixa7 Hxa7 36 e5! dxe5 37 £>xe5 Ha2 38 Axc5 1-0 A eulogy to prophylaxis! By then defeating Spassky, Ljubojevic and Kavalek, the champion was leading the race after the first half of the tournament, but in the next round he missed a win on the 39th move against Hiibner and was caught by Tal, who was playing brilliandy. Their sharp rivalry forced Karpov to play for a win against Tim- man also with Black ‘In this game probably the most significant novelty of the tournament occurred,’ Karpov later stated. It had been prepared for Korchnoi, but somehow he deftly avoided this preparation. And then completely unexpect¬ edly the variation “fired” at Timman.’ Game 79 J.Timman-A. Karpov Montreal 1979,11th round YLnglish Opening A28 1 c4 Qsf6 2 £>c3 e5 3 £}f3 £ic6 4 e3 4 g3 Ab4 was intensively tested in Baguio, and therefore, not wishing to check the quality of the analytical work of Karpovas brigade, Timman is the first to deviate, hoping that his opponent’s knowledge will be less detailed in other variations. 4...Ae7 Meeting a surprise with a surprise! Karpov also turns along a rarely-used path, avoiding the main variation 4...Jlb4 5 Wc2. Now in the event of 5...0-0 6 d3 He8 7 Ad2 Axc3 8 Axc3 d5 9 cxd5 ^xd5 10 Ae2 AfS Black has no problems (Ehlvest-Kasparov, Reykjavik 1988), but 6 £M5! He8 7 WfSl? is more un¬ pleasant for him — this original thrust was in¬ troduced by Keene back in 1977. Therefore instead of 5...0-0 Black often parts with his bishop immediately: 5...Axc3 6 Wxc3 Wcl 1 a3 a5 8 b3 d5 with equality (H.Olafsson- Karpov, Malta Olympiad 1980). 5 d4 exd4 6 £ixd4 0-0 347 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 7 £ixc6 After 7 Jte2 all the same Black can play 7.. .d5!? with the idea of 8 cxd5 <S3b4! Now, since 9 e4? fails to 9...£\xe4! 10 £3xe4 Wxd5, White has to be satisfied with equality — 9 ±B\ £\bxd5 10 £ixd5 £kd5 11 0-0 ±f6 12 ®h3 ^ib6 13 Sdl (Mnes-Timman, Portoroz 1979). Another promising reaction is 7... Jtb4!? 8 0-0 Jtxc3 9 bxc3 Se8 (the opponent of the famous maestro played much more weakly: 9.. .d5? 10 cxd5 £kd5 11 £>xc6 bxc6 12 ®d4 Jte6 13 Jta3 Rubinstein-E.Cohn, Pistyan 1912) 10 f3 £3e5 11 e4 d6, which also leads to a position from modem grandmaster practice (Azmaiparashvili-Anand, Dubai rapidplay 2002). It is also worth mentioning the manoeuvre 7 ^3de2 fie8 8 £}f4, restricting the activity of the d-pawn and thereby securing control of greater space: 8...^3e5 9 Jte2 c6 10 0-0 a6 11 b3 b5 12 jtb2 d6 13 Wc2 (Timman-Miles, Bugojno 1984). 7.. .bxc6 8 Ae2 d5 9 0-0 A66 10 b3 The preparatory exchange 10 cxd5 cxd5 makes the defects in Black’s pawn structure less noticeable, and White no longer has any hopes of an opening advantage. 10.. .®e7! Karpov writes that ‘all the indications are that Black is well placed both in the centre, and on both of the flanks’, but what should especially alarm White is the absence of an important defender of his king — the knight at f3. Because of this he is soon forced to ad¬ vance one of his pawns and weaken his king’s defences. 11 ±b2 11 cxd5? loses the knight after 11..3ttre5!, while if 11 Wc2, then U..Mc5 12 f4 ®e7 looks good. The quiet development of the bishop would appear to help White avoid new problems, allowing him to hope for a success¬ ful defence on a restricted part of the board, where for the moment there are no targets to attack. Tal: ‘Opening books of recent years have unanimously evaluated the position after 11 Jtb2 in favour of White. Karpov’s simple but paradoxical reply forces this evaluation to be radically changed. Right to the end of the tournament the grandmasters analysed this continuation, seeking equality for White.’ 11 ...dxc4! The author of this unexpected capture was Igor Zaitsev, who suggested this move to Kar¬ pov during the preparations for the match in Baguio. The idea of the novelty is to expand to the utmost the activity of the black pieces, which are successfully trained on the kingside. Zaitsev, who was famed for his non-routine chess vision, immediately saw that this main virtue of the strategically seemingly ridiculous exchange would more than cancel out its basic drawback — the complete break-up of the pawn structure. 12 bxc4? 348 Anatoly the Twelfth Surprisingly, the very first independent move by White is the main cause of his defeat. Timman’s choice is bad for the reason that the rook at a8 immediately comes into play, after which the white queen proves to be over¬ loaded by defensive functions. In addition, Black acquires a new target to attack — the c4- pawn, the defence of which can again only be ensured by the queen. But at the board it was not easy to decide on 12 Jtxc4 — another defender moves away from the king. Here, apart from general con¬ siderations, concrete variations are also needed. The premature attack 12...JLxh2+? (but not Karpov’s ‘IP’ sign) 13 ‘ixluZ ^g4+ quickly peters out: 14 (&>g3 Hfg5 15 f4 Wg6 16 4?£3 Be8 17 e4. The systematic offensive 12.. .®e5 13 g3 Jlh3 (Karpov) is also ineffec¬ tive in view of 14 Bel Bfd8 15 Hff3 with ad¬ vantage to White. However, after 12...^g4! 13 g3 Black can choose between forcing a draw - 13.. .6xh2 (Karpov) 14 *xh2 Wh4+ 15 <4>gl Jtxg3 and continuing double-edged play: 13.. .6e5!? 14 &z2 ±f5 15 e4 (15 Wd4? ±d3!) 15.. Jth3 16 Bel JLc5. 12.. .Bb8! 13*c1 It is not easy to defend the bishop: the simple-minded 13 fibl? loses to 13...fixb2 14 Bxb2 ®e5 (Karpov), but also after 13 Wc2 We5» 14 g3 Af5 15 Wcl We6 16 Bdl %)g4 Black’s pressure is extremely unpleasant. 13.. .41g4 } ‘Black’s attack develops easily and sponta¬ neously.

White would have lost quickly after 14 h3P We5 15 g3 4^xf2! 16 Bxf2 Bxb2! 17 Wxb2 Wxg3+ 18 Bg2 Wxe3+ etc. But the exchange 14 Jlxg4 Jtxg4 was necessary, and now not 15 Bel Bb4! (Kholmov), but 15 h3, hoping in the event of 15...Jtf5 16 %3e2 Wg5 17 £lf4 to gradually neutralise the opponent’s initiative, although after 15...Ah5! 16 4ia4 (16 Bel We5! 17 f4 ®e7) 16...c5 17 ±c3 Bfe8 it is not easy to do this. 14.. .Be8! The immediate attack with sacrifices 14.. .£>xh2 15 <4>xh2 Wh4+ 16 ^g2 Hi3+ 17 ipgl Jtxg3 18 fxg3 Wxg3+ 19 'ihl seemed to Karpov to be sufficient only for a draw by perpetual check. 349 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Indeed, the inclusion of the rook at e8 does not bring success: 19...fle8!? 20 flf3! ^8^4+ 21 ‘ifegl! (the incautious 21 <4>g2? would allow Black to break up the opponent’s defences in computer-like style: 21...2e5! 22 Sg3 Jkh3+! 23 ^£2 fif5+ 24 Af3 ±g4 25 <A>g2 Axf3+ 26 fixf3 Ug5+ 27 <4>fl fftil+ 28 <4>e2 Wi5! 29 £\e4 fig2+ 30 %3£2 fig3 and wins) 21...fie6 22 Afl fig6+ 23 ±g2 ±h3 24 flxh3 #xh3 25 Wd2, and Black must give perpetual check — 25.. .5xg2+ 26 ®xg2 WxeJf 27 *h2 Wh6+. 15£id1?

The comparatively best 15 Wc2 allows the standard attack 15...^xh2 16 (SJ)xh2 Wh4+ 17 <4^1 Axg3 18 fxg3 WxgTf 19 <4hl He6! It appears to be time for White to resign, but he unexpectedly finds a possibility of prolonging the resistance, by taking play into an endgame where his extra piece provides little consola- tion: 20 J.h5!

This spectacular finish to the raid by the knight into the opponent’s rear, which was overlooked by Timman, deprives White of his last illusions. 18 fxg3 #xd6 19 4f2 After 19 <S?g2 Karpov gives a win by \9..Mh6 20 g4 Wg5 21 e4 ®xcl 22 Axel flxe4 23 £\c3 2e8. I would have preferred 19.. .1fd5+ 20 ilh3+ 21 &f2 Wd3 22 Ae2 ®T5+ 23 ^el c5 24 ttc3 ®g5, but the choice here is a matter of taste. 19.. J?h6 20 Ad4 «h2+ The fact that the game continued can be explained only by Timman’s unwillingness to resign so early. 21 *e1 ®xg3+ 22 4d2 #g2! 23 %b2 ±a6 24 ^d3 l.xd3! 25 *xd3 2bd8 26 ±f1 #e4+ 27 4c3 c5! 28 ±xc5 Wc6 29 4b3 2b8+ 30 4>a3 2e5 31 jLb4 Wb6, and only here did White finally resign (0-1). This is one of those wins that makes an es¬ pecially terrible impression on professionals. Just think: to effectively win in 20 moves (!), in a harmless opening variation®, and without any blunders by the opponent®. Karpov again became the sole leader, but, as often happens after an unusually emotional game, there came a temporary slurftp in his play. In the next round he unexpectedly lost with White to the tournament outsider Larsen, 350 Anatoly the Twelfth who surprised the champion after 1 e4 with the rare Scandinavian Defence — l...d5 (Inci¬ dentally, this was also played against me by Anand in the 14th game of our match. New York 1995). At the time the Dane gave this amusing explanation: ‘Hort said to me: “Well yes, you’re a Scandinavian]” I replied: “Yes, but this is simply a good variation of the Caro- Kann!” I think that against Karpov the idea of avoiding pawn weakenings is a good one.’ Indeed, Karpov defeated Larsen in the Caro-Kann both before this game — in Bugo- jno (1978), and many times after it — in Til¬ burg (1979 and 1982), Amsterdam (1980) and Linares (1983). But — regarding the question of unforgiving chess players! — as soon as the opportunity presented itself, he also gained convincing revenge on the Dane in the Scan¬ dinavian Defence (Mar del Plata 1982). In the end the Montreal ‘Tournament of Stars’ concluded in a triumph for the world champion and the ex-world champion: 1-2. Karpov and Tal — 12 out of 18; 3. Portisch — IOV2; 4. Ljubojevic - 9; 5-6. Spassky and Timman — 8V2; 7-9. Hort, Hiibner and Kavalek - 8; 10. Larsen — 5Vz. ‘This was not the best tournament in Kar¬ pov’s career, and yet he played better than anyone!’ Tal modestly remarked. ‘Karpov had Tal as his second, and Tal had Karpov as his second. It turned out that he trains me no worse than I train him.’ At that time the ex¬ champion had not yet abandoned the hope of again forcing his way through to a match for the world championship: soon afterwards he brilliantly won the Interzonal tournament in Riga. For his part, over a period of two years Karpov won a whole series of tournaments, large and small, and every one of his rare de¬ feats became a genuine sensation. Thus at the start of the European Team Championship in Skara (January 1980), where I made my debut for the USSR team, the champion suddenly lost with White to Miles, who replied to 1 e4 with the audacious l...a6P! This was the Eng¬ lishman’s sole success during the entire history of their encounters with the classical time con¬ trol, Karpov scoring 12 wins against him, all with White (for one of them, see GameNo.87). In May 1980 Karpov set off with Tal and Polugayevsky to a super-tournament of 12 grandmasters in Bugojno. After his recent defeat at the hands of Polugayevsky in the Candidates match, it was no longer ‘the same’ Tal, but good form was demonstrated by Lar¬ sen. After seven rounds the leading positions were as follows: Larsen — 5Y2; Timman — 4V2; Karpov and Polugayevsky — 4; Andersson, Ljubojevic and Tal — 3V2. From this it is ap¬ parent just how important was the 8th round game between the world champion and his second. On this occasion, obviously remembering his difficulties against Tal in the Sicilian De¬ fence {Game No. 72), Karpov decided again to ‘serve from the other side’ — and he gained an impressive win in what was then the most topical branch of the Meran Variation. Game 80 A.Karpov-M.Tal Bugojno 1980, 8th round _Semi-Slav Defence D48_ 1 c4 e6 2 £ic3 d5 3 d4 c6 4 e3 £if6 5 £>f3 £ibd7 6 ±63 (6 Wc2 - Game Nos.101 and 102) 6...dxc4 7 ixc4 b5 8 ±63 a6 It was hard for these players, closely tied by 351 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors joint analytical work, having to fight each other. To engage in a theoretical dispute in public would be absurd, and so the grandmas¬ ters tried to surprise each other: Karpov avoided 1 e4, and Tal replied with an opening that was rare for him. 9e4c5 10d5c411 dxe6 cxd3 Black avoids ll...fxe6 (Game No. 103) in fa¬ vour of a less sharp move, which at the time was considered quite acceptable. 12 exd7+ #xd7 13 0-0 £A novelty. Usually 13 Jlg5 or 13 e5 was played/ (Karpov). After 13 e5 &Sd5 14 ttxd3 practice has shown that White allows his op¬ ponent excellent counterplay on the light squares: 14...^xc3 15 ®xc3 Ab7 16 0-0 ffc8 17 Wb3 Ae7 etc. 13...Ab7 14 lei Reckoning that the d3-pawn is doomed. White does not force events by the advance of his e-pawn, but prepares more favourable conditions for future operations. 14.. .Ab4 This move was abandoned after the present game, although die way things developed showed that Black’s position was defensible. The following line remained under examina¬ tion by theoreticians somewhat longer: 14.. .Jte7 15 e5 £id5 16 £>e4 0-0 17 Wxd3 Wg4. But in the end it transpired that after 18 <?3fg5! the slight activity of Black’s pieces does not compensate for his pawn deficit: 18.. .flad8 19 a3 f5 20 exf6 gxf6 21 Wh3! WxM 22 £3xh3 Sfe8 23 itd2 (Karpov-Lutz, Dortmund 1994), or 18...flfd8 19 h3 Wh5 20 <53g3 ®g6 21 'Srxg6 hxg6 22 a3 Sac8 23 ^3f3 M 24 J,g5 (6 25 exf6 gxf6 26 J,d2 (Piker- Shirov, Aruba 1995). Since that time ll...cxd3 has been firmly confined to the ‘archives’, being considered less sharp and promising than its rival ll...fxe6. 15 ^e5 #e6 Other moves are no better. For example, in the event of 1S..Mc7 Black’s activity comes to an end after 16 Af4! Jlxc3 17 ^3xd3 Wd7 18 bxc3 fld8 19 fle3 0-0 20 Jlg5 with advantage. 16£ixd3 Axc3 17 £tf4?

After 17 bxc3 0-0-0 18 B Wc4 19 Ee3 ^g4! 20 fxg4 Axe4 21 We2 Axd3 22 ttc5 the best way out for him would probably be to force a draw — 23 Aa3»xa3 24®c6+. 17...®d7 Tt was bad to play 17...Hfe5 18 bxc3 0-0 19 <S^d3, when 19...Wxc3 fails to 20 Jtb2.’ (Kar¬ pov). But in my opinion, the centralisation of the queen and the regaining of the pawn would have allowed Black to hope for equal¬ ity: 20...Wc6 21 Scl Wb6 22 £k5 Sad8 23 Ac8. In addition, it is not clear whether White could have breached Black’s defences after the queen sacrifice: 17...Axel 18 4ixe6 Axf2+ 19 352 Anatoly the Twelfth &x£2 fxe6! (19...£ke4+? 20 4>gl fee6 21 #115+! g6 22 #e5) 20 e5 <£ie4+ 21 4>gl 0-0. 18 bxc3 ^xe4 The other way of exchanging queens is du¬ bious — 18...Wxdl 19 Bxdl, after which White has a forced way to retain his extra pawn: 19.. .<Sdxe4 20 Jla3 (Karpov) 20...Bd8 21 Bel! 4>d7 22 B £id6 23 Badl <4>c6 24 £\e6! £xe6 25 Bxe6.

Signalling the start of the attack The black king feels uncomfortable, despite the absence of the queens. 24.. .Bac8? Now the king is completely deprived of its pawn protection, and the white rooks become rampant. Hopes of saving the game were offered by 24.. .bxc4!, preserving the a6-pawn. In this case the king would still have had something re¬ sembling a shelter. Karpov gives the short variation 25 Babl+ <4^6 26 2b4 with the evaluation ‘±\ but after 26...Bac8! 27 a4! g5!

Icd8 27 axb5 Karpov consistently carries out his plan. The black king is covered against rook attacks by the enemy pawn, but White finds a way of getting rid of it. However, the elegant 27 Bad!

In the next round the champion defeated Timman with Black in good style (a Ruy Lo¬ pez, the Zaitsev Variation which had come into fashion — 9...Jib7 10 d4 Be8), and then won £to order’ against Kavalek and Gligoric. Four successive wins — and all his rivals were left behind: 1. Karpov — 8 out of 11; 2. Larsen — 7V2; 3. Timman — 6V2, etc. A month and a half later the double-round IBM tournament of eight players began in Am¬ sterdam. Before it started Larsen and Timman declared that they would fight for first place and ‘put an end to Karpov’s victories’. And whereas Larsen, who was out of form, ended up at the bottom of the tournament table, Timman kept his promise and competed with the champion right to the finish. Karpov arrived at this tournament with one of the new hopes of Soviet chess, the 1978 world junior champion Sergey Dolmatov. The young player’s repertoire included the fashion¬ able Chelyabinsk Variation of the Sicilian De¬ fence. Dolmatov, naturally, also employed it against Karpov. This instructive game requires a short introduction. The peak of Karpov’s strength coincided with the rapid development of the Chelyab¬ insk Variation, but the champion’s suffocating style scared off Black players from the thought of employing this strategically risky set-up against him. The game with Dolmatov con¬ firmed these fears, and for a long time it made grandmasters unwilling to play this against Karpov. Only in 1994 did Lautier venture to do this and he easily gained a draw, but by that time Karpov would only rarely begin a game with 1 e4. Game 81 „ A. Karpo v-S.

Its development will be described in detail in Volume 6. 9£>d5 Karpov employed only this variation, which is strategically the most solid. He played four games with it and won two of them, one on the 101 st(!) move against Yurtaev in 1979. 9...jte7 10 Axf6 JLxf6 11 c3 0-0 12 £ic2 Ib8 At that time this rook move, inhibiting the undermining advance a2-a4, was considered to be an important subtlety, since the position after 12.. Jtg5 13 a4 bxa4 14 Sxa4 was judged to favour White. 13 jke2 (when playing 12...flb8, in the first instance Black must be prepared for 13 h4! — cf. Volume 6) ^...^gS 14 0-0 ±e6 14...a5 is deemed to be more accurate, de¬ priving the white knight of the b4-square and preparing to contest the outpost at d5 by ...£k6-e7. 15#d3 *d7 354 Anatoly the Twelfth A natural development of the queen with the aim of connecting the rooks, but here too 15...a5 was better. 16#g3! f6?! Persisting in his aim to keep control of the e3-square, Black goes in for a completely unnecessary weakening of the light squares and in addition he deprives his bishop of the excellent route g5-d8-b6. Meanwhile, 16... Jtd8 17 ^3ce3 g6 was quite possible, deferring the exchange of this bishop until better times. 17 flfdl a5 Now this advance, which literally a move ago promised definite counterplay, is no longer effective. 18 4ba3! An excellent and unexpected decision! The bishop is watching for the appearance of the knight at e3, in order to promptly exchange it, and so the knight goes a different way. For a player who blindly believes in the classical rules, it is hard to imagine that the return of the knight to the edge of the board is the strongest continuation. By beginning a battle on the queenside, White forces his opponent to gradually turn to passive defence. 18...4ba7 The further pawn advance on the queen- side — 18...b4 would merely have worsened Black’s position after 19 4^c4 bxc3 20 bxc3: his bishop is cut off from d8, and the white rook already stands at dl. 19 h3! (the planned exchange of the light- squared bishops is clearly advantageous to White) 19...*h8 It should be said that Black’s inaccurate play in the opening has by no means led to an immediate strategic fiasco, since there are no obvious weaknesses in his position and all that is evident is not too great a difference in the activity of the pieces. But from this moment the game is transformed into a splendid, text¬ book example of how to break down the op¬ ponent’s defences by the accumulation of small pluses. In such work for a long time Karpov had no equals! 20 i.g4! Sfc8?! Nevertheless Black should have played 20...f5 and, after bringing his bishop into play (but not exchanging it for a knight), set up a defence after the exchanges 21 exf5 JlxfS 22 0\c2 Jtxg4 23 ttxg4 H?xg4 24 hxg4. Although White still holds the initiative, it is not at all easy for him to achieve anything real, for ex¬ ample: 24...^c6 25 <§3ce3 g6 26 a4 27 ^xe7 Jtxe7 28 b4 axb4 29 cxb4 bxa4 30 2xa4 Hf7 31 4£\d5 Jtg5, and the limited amount of material remaining allows Black to hope for a draw. 21 Jlxe6 #xe6 22 Wd3! Hc5?! Again a natural and rather weak manoeu¬ vre, allowing White to begin active play. The immediate 22...g6 was better. All the same Black cannot get by without his thematic move, preparing ...f6-f5. 23 <£>c2 g6 355 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 24 b4! Karpov begins a new and far from obvious operation, aimed at removing the pawn ob¬ structions on the queenside and clearing the way for his rook. He has already outlined the contours of the future offensive. 24.. .axb4 25 £>cxb4 2b7 26 a4! bxa4 27 2xa4 f5 28 2a6! £ic8 Black has to retreat, since the active 28.. .^b5 would have allowed the white pieces to approach the king along the undefended 8th rank: 29 fla8+ 30 4k6 fic8 31 exf5! (choosing the right moment for this exchange enables the king’s fortress to be weakened even more) 31...gxf5 32 Uxc8 HSfxc8 33 Sbl! fia7 34 Wxb5 Wxa6 35 WbSl Therefore Dolmatov blocks the dangerous line with his knight 29 Sa8 4?g7 A new phase of the battle begins. To win, White must find a way to break up the oppo¬ nent’s still solid defences. 30 *e2 30 Wa6! 1§cT7 31 exf5! was more energetic, forcing Black to take with the pawn, which weakens his king’s shelter: 31...gxf5 32 Wd3 Wf7 33fldal. 30.. .fxe4 This capture breaks up Black’s pawn chain and creates the danger of increasing the op¬ ponent’s domination on the light squares (which in fact happened in the end). But the exchange of knights 30..,£ie7 31 ^lxe7 JLxe7 would also not have eased Black’s position, since the key d5-square would again be occu¬ pied by a knight — 32 £}d5 Jtg5 33 c4. 31 Wxe4 Wf5 32 We2 2f7 33 c4 £,h4 34 Sfl 34.. .£>e7 According to Dvoretsky, this is a definite positional mistake: Why exchange the “super¬ fluous” white knight at b4? True, after 34.. .e4!? (with the idea of ...We5-d4) many years later Yuri Yakovich pointed out a very 9 strong reply: 35 Sa3! (threatening Se3), and if 35.. Jfc.g5, then 36 £41 (not 36 £3 We5) 36...Af6 37 g4 Wc6 38 *hl followed by 39 fie3. Therefore Black does better to restrict himself to the waiting move 34... Jlg5!, and if 35 Sfal, then either continue waiting tactics (35...h5; 35.Jfc.h4), or nevertheless play 35...e4!?, not fearing 36 flel Ah4 37 ttb2+ '#e5 38 lrxe5+ dxe5 39 g3 Jtf6 40 <5ixf6 Sxf6 41 Hxe4 £)d6 with a probable draw.’ In my view, retaining the linkage of the white knights would also have threatened Black with serious unpleasantness. Thus if 34.. .Jtg5 35 Hfal e4 36 Hel Ah4, then 37 g3 Jtd8 38 <£k2 is very strong, when the 'super¬ fluous’ knight successfully comes into play: 38.. .jta5 39 £ke3 Wxh3 40 Wb2+ <4>g8 41 fial JLd8 42 Wd4. White’s total domination in the centre, combined with the activity of his rooks, makes Black’s position barely defensi¬ ble, for example: 42...We6 43 Sla6! ®e5 44 ®xe5 dxe5, and a sudden leap by the knight decides the game — 45 ^lc3! jtg5 46 ^lxe4 356 Anatoly the Twelfth Jtxe3 47 £ixc5 Hxf2 48 ! Things are also difficult for Black after 35...Jkh4 (instead of 35.. .e4) 36 g3 AdS (the piece sacrifice 36.. .®xh3 is insufficient: 37 gxh4 ®xh4 38 £>e3 £ib6 39 fi8a7) 37 h4. 35 Ea6 The immediate 35 4ixe7 jk,xe7 36 ^3d5 would have allowed Black to bring his rook, stuck at c5, back into play — 36...flc8! 35.. .®d7? This move suggests itself, but it deserves serious criticism — Black is unable to hold out by passive play. The best practical chance was the pawn sacrifice 35...^xd5 36 5\xd5 e4! 37 lxd6 ®e5 38 S.a6 ®d4, activating the pieces with chances of a draw. 36 We4 ®ixd5 37 £ixd5 ±e7 38 Sfal Af8 Black can no longer activate his game — 38.. .®fi 39 ®e2 ih4 40 g3. 39 #e2 fic6 40 36a3! Karpov’s ability to see the entire board is staggering. After doubling rooks'on the a-file, he suddenly sharply changes the direction of the attack and makes an unexpected manoeu¬ vre, which decisively strengthens his position. Since Black does not have a more useful move than the return of his rook to c5. White re¬ moves the rook at f7 from the game, thereby weakening the defence of the king. His other rook can now threaten not only to invade on the a-file, but also to switch to the kingside via a3 and f3. What becomes noticeable here is the dominating role of the knight at d5, which prevents the rook at c5 from returning in time to the aid of its king, leaving it performing the role of an observer. 40...fic5 41 Sf3! Sxf3 42 #xf3 #f7 43 ®g4 h5 Black is forced to go in for this new weak¬ ening, in order to safeguard his monarch. 44 ®e4 Bc8 After 44...<A)h7 a shuttle raid by the rook concludes the battle: 45 Ha3 Ag7 46 g4! ®d7 47 Hf3! (the technical endgame after 47 gxh5 ®f5 48 hxg6+ ®xg6+ 49 ®xg6+ <4>xg6 50 Hg3+ (4)f7 51 Sg4 is too small a reward for such a successful campaign) 47...hxg4 48 hxg4 ®e6 49 fia3!

Nothing is changed by 44...^hb 45 fia8 Ag7 46 g4! 45 Ea3 45.. .#f5 This prevents the invasion of the rook on the f-file, but it now strikes a blow from the opposite flank. After 45...2b8 46 B.B the counter-invasion 46...®b7 47 ^h2 ®bl is inef¬ fective: 48 ®h4 ®cl 49 Wf6+ *h7 50 ®f7+ Ag7 51 ®c7 Bbl 52 fif7 ®gl+ 53 ^g3 3b3+ 54 f3 h4+ 55 st?xh4 ®f2+ 56 g3 and wins. Af¬ ter 46...®d7 47 flf6 ®e8 the win of the queen by 48 &Sc7 Sl?xf6 49 ®f3+ sbe7 50 <Slxe8 fixe8 gives Black hopes of setting up a fortress, but the energetic 48 f4! quickly forces capitulation: 48.. .exf4 49 Se6 ®f7 50 4kf4. 357 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors And in the event of 46...We6 (perhaps the toughest defence) White should not win either the queen (47 fif6 Wxf6), or a pawn (47 £}f4 ®f5 48 ®xf5 gxf5 49 ^xh5+ 4?g6 with coun¬ terplay). After 47 tfh4! e4 (47...flb7 48 flf6 ±e7 49 lxe6 Axh4 50 g3) 48 He3 #e5 49 Wxe4 the win is technically simple. 46 la7+ *h6 If 46...<A)h8 the elegant tactical blow 47 £if6! is decisive, taking play into a simply won queen endgame: 47...1rxf6 (47..

The immediate 49...#bl+ 50 <4>g2 fib7 51 Iixb7 Wxb7 was more tenacious, although after 52 Wf3 itg7 53 gxh5 the game would have gone into an endgame where Black has no way of opposing his opponent’s light- squared domination. 50 hxg4 ®b1 + 51 <4>g2 The black queen has been sidelined. White has acquired an outpost at f5 for his knight, and the route a7-a3-h3 is open for the rook It is not possible to weaken the terrible effect of this manoeuvre by 51...e4 52 2a3 ^g6, since after 53 c5! Black cannot take the pawn (53...dxc5? 54 Wa6+!), and 53...Hc8, the only seemingly acceptable continuation, allows a pretty con¬ cluding attack 54 ®c4! flxc5 55 @d4! Jig7 56 ^e7+ 57 Wxd6 etc. Therefore Black’s desire to exchange rooks is logical and appears to be a measure that eases his position. 51...m>7 52 fixb7 #xb7 53 #f3! It transpires that the black queen is unable to come to the aid of its king on account of a trivial mate: 53...1rg7 54 tth3+ <4>g6 54 lfh5. There are hardly any pieces left on the board, but the difference in the strengths of the two small armies is such that the battle concludes immediately. 53...®c8 54 ®f6+ *h7 55 Wf7+ 1-0 If 55...^hS, then 56 ^h£6 is decisive, while if55...4>h6-56£ie3. In the next round Karpov lost with Black to Ribli, and the second half of the tourna¬ ment developed into a sharp race with Tim- man. In the penultimate, 13th round the champion had White against Ribli and, taking account of the tournament situation, was ea¬ ger for immediate revenge. And — very typical of Karpov — again the result was a textbook example on the accumulation of minute advantages combined with inexorably increasing pressure, which in the end broke the opponent’s will to resist.

This move (instead of the earlier 10...Wd6), which first occurred in the game Timman- Olafsson (Amsterdam 1976), forced it to be admitted that here there are no particular dif¬ ficulties for Black. After seeing it at the board, Karpov immediately remembered how the source game had gone and, after some thought, devised a novelty (see below). 11 £td4 Standing at d5, the queen keeps the a2- pawn under fire, not allowing the white rook to come into play. But it cannot advanta¬ geously be driven away: 11 4^d2 Wh5, or 11 ^2ig5 ®e5. Interesting complications can arise unexpectedly quickly for such an colourless set-up after 11 Wcl b6 12 d4 cxd4 13 4^xd4 ^xd4 14 Jtxd5 4ixe2+ 15 &g2 4^xcl 16 ±xa8 ±xb2 17 Hbl ±f6! 18 Bfxcl Bxa8, and the situation is discharged (Bagirov- Tukmakov, Tbilisi 1978). 11..

After 17...Wd7 18 Ba5 ttxa4 19 Bxa4 fifc8 20 Bbl b6, as in the game, Black would have had to defend an inferior endgame. 16Hb5!? eAn innovation, thought up by me during the game.’ (Karpov). It does not claim to re¬ fute Black’s opening set-up, but it sets him new problems. 16.. .b6 An acceptable reaction, but not the best. There was a clearer way to equalise — 16...Wa6! 17 Wb3 b6 18 Bb4 flfc8 19 fia4 Wb7 20 Bfal h5! (Ehlvest-Polugayevsky, Reggio Emilia 1991), or 18...Sfb8 19 Bc4 b5 20 Sc7 e6 21 Bfcl h5 with an unclear game (Anders- son-Timman, Ubeda 1997). 17 #a1! Exploiting the fact that, with the pawn on b2, the al-square is inaccessible to the black bishop, White wants to tie the rook at a8 to the defence of the a7-pawn. If this rook were able to switch to the 7th rank, the conflict would be exhausted. 17.. .*xa1? 359 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors With the aim of ‘drying’ the play and con¬ cluding peace as soon as possible, Black con¬ demns himself to suffering in a position where his best option will already be to go into a rook endgame a pawn down. Undoubtedly £17...®e6 was preferable’ (Karpov) — with the queens on it is easier to hold such a position: 18 #a4 fifc8 19 Hb4 #<15 20 flal Wh5 (Hansen-Sutovsky, Esbjerg2001). Of course, when analysing the position in a calm situation, one can resolve the simple problems posed by 16 Hb5 without particular difficulty. But at the board Zoltan Ribli was unable to find the correct way, although at that time, at the peak of his career, he was famed for his subtle positional understanding. 18 Hxal It transpires that Black lacks a tempo to prevent the invasion of the rook at a6, which is extremely unpleasant with his rook on a8. Suddenly he finds himself in difficulties. 18.. .1tfb8 Ribli adopts a passive stance, intending to finally remove the rook from a8 after 19.. .flb7. There is nothing for this rook to do on the open c-file: 18...Sfc8 19 Sa6! fic2 20 b3 Bxe2 21 2bxb6 (Karpov) 21..JSel+ 22 4?g2 Hal 23 Hxal Axal 24 Sa6. 19Ha6!

Subde. ‘If 21 b3 Black would manage to de¬ fend - 21..Jtc7 22 Hba4 Hb7.’ (Karpov) 21.. .b5? The decisive mistake. Now the transition into the difficult endgame ‘5 against 4’ be¬ comes a dream, the fulfilment of which de¬ pends entirely on White’s desire. According to Karpov, £21...Axb2 22 Axb6 Hb7 23 Axa7 Hc8 should have been preferred, when it is not at all easy for White to win this endgame.’ 22 2a2 2b7 23 b3! A warning signal for Black. Rather than the immediate win of a pawn by 23 Axa7 Axb2 24 Hxb2 Haxa7 25 Bxa7 Hxa7 26 Hxb5, Kar¬ pov prefers positional pressure, continuing to wear down his opponent. 23.. .Ab8 24 Ac5 (now Black has also been deprived of the c-file) 24...4e8 25 d4 4d7 26 e4!

A win at the finish over Larsen put every¬ thing in its place: 1. Karpov — 10 out of 14 (+7—1=6); 2. Timman — 9; 3. Sosonko — 8; 4. Hort — 7V2; 5-6. Dolmatov and Ribli — 7, etc. A considerable stir was also caused by the champion's second successive victory at the autumn super-tournament in Tilburg. Initially in the 2nd round he defeated Ribli with Black — revenge again! In the 3rd round he unex¬ pected lost with White to Larsen (Volume 4, Game No.48), but then ‘in his anger' he in¬ flicted defeats on Timman, Hiibner, Anders- son and Spassky! Against the ex-world cham¬ pion Karpov again extracted the evergreen Keres Attack from his armoury. 361 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Game 83 A. Karpov-B.

Jte7 — GameNo.7T) 1 h4 Later Karpov turned to 7 Bgl (Game No. 89), whereas he abandoned 7 g5 hxg5 8 Jtxg5 after two games with Anders son (Skara 1980; Bugojno 1980), where Black equalised with 8...£>c6 9 Wd2 Wb6 10 £ib3 a6 11 0-0-0 Wcl followed by ...Ad7, ..JLc7, ...0-0-0, ..JLc8 and ...£>g8!? 7.. .£>c6 8 Bgl d5!? The most critical continuation, if Black is sawing for an active battle in the centre. Oth¬ erwise, by advancing his g-pawn on the next move, White would have driven back the knight from f67 (Karpov) Another thrust is more often employed — 8.. .h5. In the 1st game of our 1984/85 match Karpov played 9 gxh5, and after 9...£\xh5 10 ±g5 £>f6 11 Wd2 Wb6 12 £>b3 ±d7 13 0-0-0 a6 (a set-up similar to that employed by Anders son — cf. above) I successfully solved my opening problems (more details about this in Volume 7). 9 g5 £}g4 10 jte2 runs into the counter 10.. .d5l, which was devised by the Hungarian grandmaster Andras Adorjan, who was famed for his interesting style of play and even more for his original discoveries in many openings. I analysed this idea with him before my first match with Karpov, and its viability was con¬ firmed by one of Andras’s games: 11 4ixc6 bxc6 12 jtxg4 hxg4 13 #'xg4 d4 14 £>e2 e5! (Sznapik-Adorjan, Dortmund 1984). 9 ±b5 ±67 10 exd5 ^xd5 (if 10...exd5, then 11 We2+ Ae7 12 J,e3 a6 13 ±d3 is quite good for White) 11 ^xd5 exd5 Simplification such as ll...^xd4 12 jk,xd7+ #xd7 13 Wxd4 Wxd5 14 WxdS exd5 leads after 15 Jte3 to a tedious position where it is hard for Black to display any activity. He can probably defend, but why play such an open¬ ing set-up? 12 Jte3! ‘Development first and foremost! There was another tempting possibility — 12 We2+, which after 12...We7 13 Jte3 ^xd4 14 Jtxd7+ <4’xd7 15 jtxd4 would have led to some ad¬ vantage for White, but after 12... jte7 13 Jtxf5 14 gxf5 ifB the position does not seem so clear to me.5 (Karpov) 12...JLe7 It looks risky to play 12...ttxh4 13 Wd2! (in my opinion, the best move, not allowing sim¬ plification) 13...Jte7 14 0-0-0. But after the preparatory 12...a6! 13 Jta4 the pawn may prove perfecdy edible: 13...1fch4 14 tff3 We7 15 0-0-0 We4 16 %3 0-0-0 17 £kc6 ±d6\ 18 Wxd6 Jtxc6 19 Wg3 ttxa4. 362 Anatoly the Twelfth 13*Td2 ‘13 Wc2 was also possible, trying to exploit the open position of the black king. True, then too White is subjected to danger along the undefended a5-el diagonal, and also in some cases along the e-file. Black would have had a choice between 13...®a5+ 14 c3 ^hxd4 15 Axd7+ *xd7 16 Jtxd4 She8 and 13...0-0 14 0-0-0 Hfa5, which after 15 Axc6 bxc6 16 ^Pbl looks more promising for White/ (Karpov) However, in my view, after 16...Axh4 White has to work rather hard to demonstrate that he has compensation for the pawn (say, 17 f4 fife8 etc.). Instead of 15 Axe6 he can play 15 ^bl immediately, but after 15...^ixd4 16 Axd4 Wxb5 17 ®xe7 flfe8 18 ®a3 Sac8 Black has a sound position (19 g5?! h5, and the c2-point becomes the target for a counter¬ attack). And after 13 Wf3 0-0 14 Axc6 bxc6 15 g5 Black sei2es the initiative with the pawn sacri¬ fice 15...h5! 16 #xh5 WaS-f 17 c3 Iab8. 13.. .Axh4?! ‘Formerly, as I recall, the ex-world cham¬ pion would not even have looked at such a pawn, but times change, and a liking for extra pawns can arise even with players such as Spassky. However, Black’s desire to get rid one of the pawns impending over his position is determined by a desire to remove his king to the flank, which if done immediately is dangerous: 13...0-0 14 ^f5 Af6 15 0-0-0, and it is hard for Black to parry the threats/ (Kar¬ pov). And indeed, 15...d4? already loses to 16 Axh6 gxh6 17 Wxh6. However, one of the main experts on Scheveningen set-ups, Ulf Andersson (who in recent years has played more in correspon¬ dence tournaments) found the clever defence 14.. .d4!, after which in the complications 15 Axh6 Ab4 16 c3 dxc3 17 bxc3 ^e51 18 Ae2 Se8 19 *fl Af8 20 Af4 #a5 Black gained excellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn (Timmerman-Andersson, correspon¬ dence 1995-97). The move in the game completely hands the initiative to White. 14 0-0-0 Af6?! After the relieving 14...4lxd4 15 Axd7+ Wxd7 16 Axd4 0-0 Black runs the danger of coming under a crushing attack: 17 fihl! Wd8 18 fldgl! Af6 19 g5 Axd4 20 Wxd4 (20 gxh6? #b6! 21 c3 AxG) 20...hxg5 21 ®d3 f5 22 flh5 Wd7 23 Shxg5 Sf7 24 ®h3 and wins. It seems to me that the best decision (as on the previous move) was to castle. Of course, after 14...0-0 the reply 15 g5 looks threatening. Now 15...£ixd4 is met by the strong 16 Wxd4!, when Black loses after both 16.. .Axb5? 17 gxh6 Af6 18 fixg7+ <&>h8 19 #f4 Ad7 20 Ad4, and 16...Axg5? 17 Axd7 Wxdl 18 f4. And in the event of 16...hxg5 17 Axd7 ®xd7 18 Axg5 Axg5 19 Sxg5 f6 20 2h5 White’s attack is very strong. 15...hxg5 is more cautious, and if 16 Axg5 Axg5 17 flxg5, then not 17...£btd4? because of 18 Sxg7+! <4>xg7 19 #xd4+ f6 20 flgl+ <4>f7 21 #xd5+ Ae6 22 ®xb7+ Wei 23 Sg7+, but 17., /tf6 — in this position there is still all to play for. 15 <53f5 may prove more unpleasant, when after 15...d4 16 Jtxc6 dxe3 17 ®xe3 bxc6 18 4}xh4 Wxh4 19 Hxd7 Black faces a laborious defence. 15 £tf5!? It is not at all easy for White to develop his initiative — Black has no weaknesses on the kingside, and in addition his king is not yet there! On the one hand, the knight move is good, in that White opens the g-file, practically 363 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ruling out kingside castling by Black (on the queenside too the king will not be secure); in addition White is ready to capture the d5- pawn. On the other hand, one of the main attacking pieces is exchanged, and the price for opening the g-file is the loss of a possible pawn storm. Karpov rejected the obvious 15 f4, after failing to find a clear advantage after 15...Wa5 16 ®xa5 5fxa5 17 Jtxd7+ 4)xd7, and only after the game did he discover that *by 18 £3f5! White would have gained excellent chances.5 Computer verification has shown that Karpov was right; 18...4^6 19 Ad4 Jtxd4 20 Sxd4 with advantage to White. 15 ...#c7 is no better on account of 16 g5 hxg5 17 fxg5 AeS 18 £3f3 0-0-0 19 jtxc6 Axc6 20 £ixe5 Wxe5 21 Axsil. To avoid the worst. Black should again go into an endgame - 21...flh2 22 Ad4 lxd2 23 Axc5 fixdl+ 24 Bxdl, but here too he faces an extremely un¬ pleasant defence. 15.. Jk.xf5 It is no longer possible to castle: 15...0-0? 16 £>xh6+! gxh6 17 g5! J.e5 18 f4 Ac7 19 gxh6+ *h8 20 Wxd5 Wc7 (20...±e6 21 %2i) 21 Ac5 ±xf4+ 22 *bl ®e5 23 ±xf8 and wins. 16 gxf 5 a6 Spassky intends to preserve his d-pawn as compensation for the difficulties experienced. Going into an ending — 16...H?d7!? 17 ®xd5 WxdS 18 Sxd5 a6 gave him a chance of equal¬ ising after 19 Axc6+ bxc6 20 Bd6 flc8, thanks to his passed h-pawn (21 Hel sfefB 22 fld7 h5 23 Ha7 h4 24 fixa6 h3). But by 19 ±a4! b5 20 Abl ^e7 21 Bd3 *hx£5 22 AcS Hc8 23 flel+ 43e7 24 Jtd6 Karpov could have retained the two bishops, the initiative, and real chances of success. 17 ±xc6+? A strange exchange: Black5s pawn bastion in the centre is supported, and he acquires the real possibility of hiding his king at c7 or c8 and of using the b-file for a counterattack. It is always regrettable to give up such a bishop, but White has no time to retreat it, since then the d-pawn would advance, and Black would calmly remove his king to f8, and if necessary to g8.5 (Karpov). Here he is insuf¬ ficiently concrete. With this development of events the rook at h8 remains out of play for a long time and both white bishops become very active: 17 Aa4! b5 (here 17...Wd7 is weaker than on the previous move, since apart from 18 ®xd5 White has the very unpleasant 18 Ab6\ WxB? 19 Wb4) 18 Ab3 d4 19 fh2. Now, after both 19...*f8 20 WhS #e7 21 Jtf4 fid8 22 flgel and 19...1ie7 20 WB Bc8 21 Jlf4 4ie5 22 Wg3 White has a powerful initiative. 17.. .bxc6 18 Ac5 In the event of 18 Jtd4 the fact that the d5- pawn is defended allows Black to set up a de¬ fence with the active participation of his king: 18.. .±xd4 19 Wxd4 *f6 20 ®c5 (20 ®d4 364 Anatoly the Twelfth 4>d7! 21 1Srb7+ 4>d6!) 20...*d7! 21 c4 Shb8! 22 fld2 We7 23 lrd4 Wf6 24 Ixg7 Wxd4 25 2xd4 lst?e7 26 cxd5 cxd5 27 Sxd5 fib5 with an imminent draw. 18.. JXb8 19 b4!7 Sharp and interesting play; to support his fading initiative. White decides to give up his main trump — the secure shelter of his king. After the quiet 19 b3 JSb5 20 Jtd4 Black de¬ fends by simple means: 20...jtxd4 21 ®xd4 lT6 22 Hgel+ *f8 23 fie5 Sb8 (in the event of 23...<4>g8 24 fie8+ <4>h7 25 Wxf6 gxf6 26 He7 Hf8 27 Sc7 the rook endgame is never¬ theless advantageous to White) 24 Hgl (24 Sdel ifegB) 24...h5!? and the position is not clear (only, if 25 Sgel, instead of 25...h4?? 26 Wb4+, he should move his king — 25...4^8). 19.. .2b5? When Karpov advanced his b-pawn, he thought that the opponent was obliged to sacri¬ fice the exchange. But this is not so — the worst was already over for Black, and 19...sl?d7! would have emphasised this. Both kings are poorly sheltered, and White also has to be cau¬ tious, for example: 20 We2? a5 21 c4 axb4! 22 cxd5 Wa5! 23 dxc6+ <4>c8 24 &bl b3 25 a3 ffib5, and Black goes onto the attack 20 c4 <i?c7 21 cxd5 cxd5 22 ttd3! is stronger — White still holds the initiative, but the outcome is hard to predict in this double-edged position 20 Uge1+ &d7 21 c4 Hxc5 22 bxc5 22...±g5? This fatal mistake was the result of Black overestimating his own chances. The out¬ wardly risky move 19 b4 must have excited Spassky, and he decided to punish his pre¬ sumptuous opponent. Karpov also rated his own position very optimistically and consid¬ ered 22...1Bfb8 to be the most appropriate re¬ ply, when he was intending 23 cxd5! (23 f4?! ^c81 24 cxd5 cxd5 25 fle2 Hd8 with chances for both sides) 23...JLg5 24 He3, ‘when Black has to seek salvation in the variation 24...

Black had a possibility of seriously hindering his opponent’s task — 22...Wf8! Af¬ ter the forced 23 Wb4 he can take play into an endgame: 23...®b8 24 ®xb8 Sxb8 25 cxd5 Sb5 (or 25...a5 26 Se4 cxd5 27 Sxd5+ <4,c6 28 Sd3 ^xc5 29 Sa4!) 26 dxc6+ <4)xc6 27 ld6+ <&>c7 28 lxa6 Sxc5+ 29 &dl Sxf5 30 4>e2, and it is still not easy for White to win. 23 f4 wm It was on this unexpected riposte that Spassky was pinning his hopes. Now it is not possible to block the diagonal by natural means: 24 fle5? Wxe5! 25 fxe5 jtxd2+ 26 Hxd2 Se8, and it is not easy even for White to save himself. But... 24 cxd5! Apparently Spassky underestimated this capture, and had been counting beforehand on 24 fxg5?

He noticed his oversight when it was too late, although the logic of the struggle should have suggested to him that any winning variations here for Black were accidental, and he should have carefully checked them before basing his decisions on them. 365 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 24...#31+ 25 4?c2 «rxa2+ 26 4>d3 #xd2+ 26...trb3+ 27 Wc3 WbSf 28 #c4 ±h4 was more tenacious, but after 29 flgl JL£6 30 d6 the win for White is merely a question of time. 27 2xd2 ±xf4 28 Sa2! This concludes the game. The threat of d5- d6 does not allow Black to defend his a6- pawn, after which both White’s rooks and his king become terribly active. 28...cxd5 29 Hxa6 h5 30 4?d4 h4 31 4>xd5 Sb8 32 f6 gxf6 33 Hxf6 ±g3 34 Sxf7+ 4>d8 35 Sf8+ 1-0 The effect of this game was such that for a time 8...d5 went out of use, and in similar situations the advance ...d6-d5 began to be regarded with great suspicion. A draw at the finish with Tal secured the champion a new success: 1. Karpov — 714 out of 11 (+5—1=5); 2. Portisch — 7; 3. Timman — 6/4; 4-5. Sosonko and Spassky — 6; 6. Tal — 5/4, etc. On the background of these almost con¬ tinuous successes the only slight cloud was a share of 4th-5th places at a tournament in Buenos Aires and a loss with White against Timman in a sharp variation of the Sicilian Defence. Here Larsen and Timman finally achieved their cherished dream — they finished ahead of the world champion, by taking the first two places. Immediately after this Karpov headed the USSR team at the Olympiad (Malta, November-December 1980) and scored +6=6. I was the second reserve in that event and it was only with enormous difficulty, on the tie-break, that we finished ahead of the strong Hungarian team. The gold medals were secured by the last-round Karpov-Jacobsen game, which was adjourned in a difficult rook endgame and accurately won by our leader on the resumption. In 1981, shortly before the next match for the world championship, when it had already transpired that his opponent would again be Korchnoi, the champion initially played in a match-tournament of four Soviet teams (here, for the first time, I battled with him one-to- one: the outcome was two fighting draws), and then in three strong tournaments — Linares (1-2. Christiansen and Karpov — 8 out of 11; 3. Larsen — 7), Moscow7 (1. Karpov — 9 out of 13; 2-4. Kasparov, Polugayevsky and Smyslov — 7/4) and Amsterdam (1. Timman — 7/4 out of 11; 2-3. Karpov and Portisch — 7). To judge by the number of wins, and above all by their quality and diversity of style, the 30-year-old Karpov was in optimal form and looked the favourite in the forthcoming battle for the crown. 'There are no easy Matches' The match in Merano (autumn 1981), in con¬ trast to Baguio, is remembered by Karpov Nvith tenderness and pleasure: the countryside, the people, the unsurpassed organisation of the event; and also the victory itself was beau¬ tiful, unequivocal, rapid...5 But at the time, immediately after his win, he stated: ‘The match, although it turned out to be short, de¬ manded both intensity and serious nervous stress. There were practically no short draws: in every game, apart from the 17th, the battle went on to the “bare55 kings. Therefore the match has to be called difficult — but strictly speaking, there are no easy matches for the world championship.5 366 Anatoly the Twelfth The world champion’s preparations were on an unprecedented comprehensive and fundamental scale. Igor Zaitsev relates: T>uring the three years separating Baguio from Merano the number of those wishing to help us in our work increased. And here it was not at all the matter of a pro-Karpov and anti- Korchnoi mood — the participation itself in analytical preparations for top-level events was considered highly prestigious (but often also obligatory — G.K). And I, in my capacity as the world champion’s senior trainer, did every¬ thing to expand the circle of voluntary helpers. I thought that even a brief chess association with new people would enrich Karpov’s style, and make it more universal and flexible. This also ensured a continuity of views, which is extremely important for any great chess player: in the course of his formation he has to pass through his perception all the de¬ velopment stages of the centuries-old chess thinking. The arrangement of such knowledge continuity is essentially the basis of all training work. This is the guarantee of a professional’s many years of tournament stability, whereas gaps in his knowledge give rise to crises and failures. ‘Immediately before Merano the core of our training group remained the same. Balashov and I were again appointed as sec¬ onds, but an active part in the general analyti¬ cal preparation was played by Tal, Po- lugayevsky (they also travelled to Merano), Geller and Vaganian. At various times we were joined by Ubilava, Mikhalchishin, Tseshkovsky, Kapengut, Kimelfeld, Lepyoshkin and Rozenberg, and one of the sessions was visited by Georgy Borisenko, a creative associate of Furman and an elder statesman of Soviet theoreticians, whom we all, from Karpov downwards, regarded with particular respect. ‘Anticipating serious opposition in the opening, we endeavoured to learn the lessons of Baguio and on this occasion we stored up a great number of important and minor theo¬ retical surprises (although, as it later tran¬ spired, not all the ideas were brought up to the necessary condition). Evidently relying on this, in the last year before the match Anatoly in¬ volved himself more in public affairs, and since the training brigade consisted mainly of active players, who regularly went off to vari¬ ous events, sometimes I had to spend the training sessions virtually in proud isolation. ‘On one such inopportune January day in 1981 the higher authorities, in the persons of the Sports Committee chairman Pavlov and the Central Committee secretary for sport Gramov, suddenly turned up out of the blue. On seeing such a strange desolation, they be¬ gan benevolently, but very insistently and nag- gingly, questioning me about the course of the preparations. But when I fetched out our chess notes, which for the uninitiated were double-dutch, the impressive appearance of the thick notebooks, crammed with numerous variations, greatly calmed them down. ‘Rumours to the effect that in the period of the matches with Korchnoi we were all held under some kind of special constraint, do not accord with reality: there were no strong measures or dressings-down at all. ‘The main training session before our de¬ parture took place in Plavinas in Latvia on the banks of a picturesque forest lake. Here we were able both to work fruitfully and to relax well, and build up our physical strength. ‘Autumn in Italy greeted us with mild sunny weather and persistent attacks by tem¬ peramental journalists. Our delegation was accommodated in a comfortable three-story villa where, much to everyone’s joy, there was even a swimming pool. True, when the build¬ ing warmed up, repulsive black crabs — scor¬ pions! — began to crawl out of all the crevices. This was a real shock. To carry out a serious analysis under such conditions was uncom¬ fortable, to say the least. What misfortune — in Baguio we had been pursued by earthquakes and typhoons, and here we came across these creatures! Fortunately, it was explained to us 367 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors that they are poisonous only in May. And litde by little we calmed down, although the scorpi¬ ons remained with us right to the end of the match... ‘As is usual in such matches, intensive analysis took place at night — especially if by morning it was necessary to urgently crack some opening problem or find the optimal solution in an adjourned position. In contrast to Baguio, there were only four of the latter — in the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 8th games. TSIowadays we have all become accustomed to a game concluding in one sitting. However, in those years the matches were still played with an adjournment after forty moves. This had its pluses: it was in the course of work on unfinished games that the art of analysis was perfected. But what a hellish strain, usually at night, was placed on the shoulders of the trainers!... When studying the specific features of games with adjournments, even before Merano I established that the adjournment, like the right of the first move, is a small but undoubted advantage for White: he can be the first to exploit — or, according to circum¬ stances, not exploit — his right to seal a move! I informed Karpov of this observation, hop¬ ing that it would come in useful to him. Later, precisely because of this additional trump for White, I took the abolishment of adjourn¬ ments to be a logical and just act. Tt is easy to work out that in an unlimited match it is always advantageous to have the white pieces in the first game. Therefore, when sending Karpov off to the drawing of lots, our parting words were like those of fas¬ tidious mushroom-gatherers: ‘Tick only the white!” But it turned out the other way round...’ The white pieces in the first game went to Korchnoi, but this did not help him. Karpov very confidently handled the Tartakower- Makogonov-Bondarevsky Variation of the Queen’s Gambit: he was not afraid to go in for a position with hanging pawns at c5 and d5, he made a timely exchange of the enemy dark-squared bishop (by ...£}f6-h5xg3), and after a mistake by White on the 24th move he carried out the typical ...d5-d4 breakthrough with great effect and scored an excellent win. Geller: ‘After this the champion gained a seri¬ ous psychological advantage.’ In the 2nd game Korchnoi tried to surprise his opponent with a rare defence in the Ruy Lopez, but this resulted in a somewhat infe¬ rior position without any real counterplay — Karpov’s forte! ‘He completely outplayed his opponent positionally. It became clear that the challenger’s defence — never his strong weapon — was on the point of collapse, and that he was unable to withstand the cham¬ pion’s systematic, although outwardly unhur¬ ried offensive. One must mention the excep¬ tional coordination that the white pieces achieved in this game,’ writes Geller, who seven years earlier, if you remember, was not enraptured by Karpov’s style. After a draw in the 3rd game, Karpov ’also won in subtle positional style in the 4th game, where again, as in the 6th game of the Mos¬ cow match (1974), the Petroff Defence oc¬ curred. But in Moscow things ended in a swift rout, whereas after the 22nd move in Merano the champion ‘would not have objected to sharing the point, had not Korchnoi intro¬ duced the procedure of offering a draw via the arbiter’. But at that moment the challenger chose a dubious plan, and his position began to deteriorate move by move... Just four games — and already three of the six required wins! Balashov: ‘Hardly anyone could guess Karpov’s moves — this is an indi¬ cation of his good form.’ Tal; ‘Karpov ran half of the distance with lightning speed!’ At that point Viktor Lvovich began com¬ plaining of feeling unwell — he was convinced that there was some reason for this and that, he reckoned, the Soviets were irradiating him with something. But this is what Alexander Roshal, who was then the Soviet delegation’s press attache, has to say regarding this today: ‘I know nothing about any influence on 368 Anatoly the Twelfth Korchnoi. In Merano there was with us an important psychologist, Kabanov. He spent a long time questioning me about how Zukhar had behaved in Baguio. When I told him of how our doctor had acquired a high opinion of himself, Kabanov smiled: “Well, that won’t happen with me.” But within a week he asked me to collect cuttings of articles in the foreign press, where his name was mentioned. I don’t know, perhaps he needed this for his report... ‘As in Baguio, there were indeed many ac¬ companying us — however, not to frighten the opponent, but for requirements of a largely technical nature: security, protection against ‘‘bugging”, and so on. In Merano everything was much simpler than in the Philippines. Korchnoi was already a spent force, and it was clear to everyone that Karpov would win the match. It was another matter when, after a series of wins, Karpov lost the 6th game, and subsequendy also the 13th, and in the Sports Committee they became slighdy alarmed (suppose Baguio were to repeat itself?) and began fussing about — they activated the Mos¬ cow “support group” and appealed to grand¬ masters for assistance... ‘Emmanuel Sztein, the press attache of the challenger’s delegation, later recalled in an interview that I had supposedly said to him when we met: “We’re going to annihilate you!” I don’t remember the exact words, but I could indeed have promised him that we would make mincemeat of them. In this there was not simply confidence, but absolute con¬ viction about our victory. I remember that I said to him: “Today the difference in playing strength between Korchnoi and Karpov is the same as between you and me!” (incidentally, despite the “warring camps”, my relations with Sztein remained perfectly correct). ‘But Korchnoi often sought the cause of his defeats outside of himself, and justified them by the interference of certain outside forces or simply chance, the good fortune of his opponent... Vishy Anand once said to me: CI have won about fifteen games against him. without any losses, and after each one of them he informed me that I have no idea about chess.’ Such a habit also occurred with other great players, but with Korchnoi, in my view, it has gone to extremes. ‘Therefore, in talking about “secret radia¬ tion”, Viktor Lvovich is flattering himself: there was nothing of the sort. And whereas I remember Baguio as being one of the most gripping and dramatic of events, Merano is more associated with the sunny ocean, the visit to Venice, and son on. Here we were able to permit ourselves a completely different way of life, not so secluded and monotonous.’ After his disastrous start Korchnoi never¬ theless managed to come to his senses — he made several draws and even gained quite a good win (Game No. 35), but in the 9th game he was struck another powerful blow. Zaitsev: ‘Korchnoi’s three painful defeats at the start were nothing to do with the opening: Karpov outplayed his opponent in the later stages of the game. But the next three wins were associated to a considerable degree with home preparation. First of all, there was a purely Karpov-like idea in the 9th game, which many remember for the manoeuvre ll...(S}h5!

Later experience showed that, in return for the temporary conceding of the centre, Black gains the opportunity to develop his queenside pieces comfortably. 8 e3 Black also equalises after 8 e4 ?lc6!

Vol¬ ume 7). 11...£>h5! An important detail of Black’s opening construction After the exchange of the dark- squared bishops, his knights completely con¬ trol the d5-square. 12 Axe7 ®xe7 13±b3?! On encountering a strong novelty, White should have curtailed the game and at home sought a more effective reaction to 7...dxc4, or even taken a critical look at the virtues of 7 Scl. 1 gained the impression/ writes Karpov, ‘that here Korchnoi realised he had not ex¬ tracted any advantage from the white pieces and had lost the opening battle, but that as though from inertia he was continuing to seek ways of playing for a win. It is for this reason that he avoids the simplification which would be inevitable after d4-d5.’ The opening of the centre 13 d5 exd5 14 £\xd5 £>xd5 15 Wxd5 (or 15 ±xd5 £>f4 16 iLe4 jk,e6) 15...®xd5 16 JLxd5 does not pre- vent Black from completing his development: 16...£ti4- 17 Jtc4 Jte6 18 g3 fiac8 with a rapid draw (Uhlmann-Kurajica, Sarajevo 1982). 13...£>f6 14 4be5 Ad7 15 We2 Ic8 16 ®e4?! From this moment Korchnoi’s position be¬ gins to deteriorate with every move. White is unable to find a clear-cut plan and he over¬ looks the fact that each exchange of minor pieces potentially weakens his d4-pawn.’ (Kar- pov) To this I should add that, when there are just heavy pieces on the board, an isolated pawn is always and only a weakness. But White’s main problem is that it is very hard for him to find a ‘clear-cut plan’ — one that does not in the end lead to a similar exchange of minor pieces and to the even more obvious 370 Anatoly the Twelfth weakness of the d4-pawn. For example, 16 Bfel Bc7!? (Karpov; but not 16..Jk,c6? 17 4htf7 Bxf7 18 Wxe6) 17 flcdl JLc6, and here 18 £}xf7 Bxf7 19 iLxe6 £}ed5 is no longer advantageous to White, while after 18 ^b5 JtxbS 19 Wxb5 <Sied5 it is far easier to guess Black’s next few moves. 16.. .£ixe4 17 Wxe4 After 17 Bxc8 Wxc8 18 Wxe4 there is a well-known method of play: 18...Ac6! 19 c6 Wxc6 20 Wxc6 bxc6! 21 fidl Sb8!, letting it be known that it is hard to get rid of the weak d4-pawn. "Black’s knight is capable both of securely defending his own pawn and of attacking the enemy d-pawn, whereas the functions of the white bishop are restricted.’ (Karpov) 17.. .J.C6 18 4ricc6 2xc6! "This way, so that White should not be able, without making some concession (for exam¬ ple, conceding the c-file), to switch his rooks to the kingside.’ (Karpov) 19 2c3?! An important moment. ‘Korchnoi spent a long time considering the consequences of the exchange on c6, and in the end he evidently realised that he had underestimated the factors outlined above.’ (Karpov). The absence of the dark-squared bishop, which could have de¬ fended the d4-pawn from e3, makes things difficult for White, and he now has to try and draw from a position of weakness: 19 ttxc6 bxc6! (an idea that is familiar to us from the 10th game of the Lasker-Capablanca match, Volume 1, Game No.90) 20 Bel Wb6 21 fic4! Bd8 22 g3.1 think that with accurate play this is a quite feasible task 19.. .Wd6 20 g3?! Karpov thinks that with this move White lost his ‘prospects of play on the kingside’. If he had any, then it seems to be that they were lost much earlier. And, if he was thinking of how to save the game, it was better to regroup along the lines of 20 flxc6 (20 Jtc2 g6) 20.. .bxc6 21 Bel fid8 22 fic4 - after 22...£tf5 23 Bxc6 ®xd4 24 Wc2 Black’s initiative is not yet threatening. 20.. .Bd8 (now the position has strategically clarified to Black’s obvious advantage) 21 Bdl 21...2b6! Karpov avoids the exchange, in order to later intensify the pressure on the d4-pawn. And, to all appearances, the fate of this pawn is now decided (as Larsen aptly remarked: iso¬ lated pawns should not be blockaded, but won!). Korchnoi does not see where he could display any activity, and so he is forced to switch to passive defence. 22 Wei Wd7! Consistently implementing the plan of in¬ tensifying the pressure on the d4-pawn. 23 Bcd3 The belated activation attempt 23 Bc5 is re¬ futed tactically: 23...Bd6 24 fidcl 4k6! 25 J,a4 £kd4! 26 ±xdl 4^S+. 371 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 23.. .fid6 24 We4 Wc6 25 Wf4 The exchange of queens leads to the loss of a pawn: 25 ®xc6 ^xc6 26 d5 ^b4, or 25.. .bxc6 26 ±c4 (26 g4 c5) 26...£\f5. 25.. .£id5! Now the queen cannot stand on an active square — 26 We4 £}b4! — and is forced to take up a less favourable position (it cannot move away from the queenside: 26 ®h4 a5 27 a4 b5!). 26 #d2 *b6! 27 Axd5?! Short of time, Korchnoi does not want to undermine the stability of his bishop by mov¬ ing his a2-pawn, and he decides to parry the threat of ...^d5-b4 in the simplest way. The position after 27 a3 28 Wf4 £lc6 29 d5 e5 30 1tfe3 <$M4 is also advantageous to Black, but possibly this was the lesser evil. 27.. .1.d5 28 2b3?! All the same a new weakening, to prevent ...e6-e5, cannot be avoided, and therefore the immediate 28 f4 was more tenacious, not moving the rook off the d-file: 28..JS8d7 29 fT2«U8 30 We3. 28.. .Wc6 29 *c3 #d7 30 f4 b6! 31 Hb4 b5! 32 a4 bxa4 33 Wa3 a5 34 Sxa4 White has won the battle for the a4-pawn, but at too high a price: his main forces are stuck on the queenside. 34.. .#b5! (the invasion of the queen at e2 threatens in an instant to destroy White’s posi¬ tion) 35 IId2 It was no better to play 35 b3 (with the idea of 35...We2 36 Wcl), agreeing to go into a bad rook endgame after 35...flb8 36 fld2 Wxb3 37 Wxb3 ttxb3 38 SLda2 Hbb5.

With die score standing at 4-1 after the ninth game, only a miracle could save Korchnoi. His nerves, to all appearances, were at breaking point Karpov: 'He insulted me during the 8th and 9th games. In the 10th he was probably afraid that the arbiters would install microphones and record his words, and so he simply talked rubbish/ Rude Pravo (Czechoslovakia): 'During the 9th and 10th games the world champion had to raise his hand five times as an indication that he was requesting the chief arbiter Paul Klein to come to the board. Klein: "During play Korchnoi swore at Karpov in Russian, insulted him and besmeared his country. We several times reprimanded Korchnoi/’ The play and correct behaviour of the world champion is in sharp contrast with Korchnoi’s behaviour.’ UPI News Agency: 'After the 12th game Karpov accused the challenger of having "shouted insulting words at him” and of con¬ stantly preventing him from concentrating, by intentionally waving his hands. In reply to this complaint, Korchnoi said that he had merely asked Karpov not to swivel in his chair and not distract him/ At three o’clock in the morning after the 12th game Baturinsky handed Gligoric, the chairman of the appeal jury, a written protest by the world champion with the required de¬ posit of 500 Swiss Francs. The following day the jury gave the challenger an official warn¬ ing, and informed him that 'a similar repeat violation would be penalised by a fine of 15,000 Swiss Francs/ But these outbursts were merely a pale shadow of the previous match... After his win in the 13th game (Game No.36) a faint ray of hope for Korchnoi appeared, but the very next game showed that here there would be no 'second Baguio’. Yuri Razuvaev, who was at that time working as coach for the USSR Sports Committee, remembers: 'Late one evening, after the 6th game, Geller and I were sud¬ denly summoned to Ivonin, the deputy head of the Sports Committee, and asked to re¬ port the following morning to his office, in order to "urgently devise for Toly a some novelty in the Ruy Lopez/’ True, at the same time, he enquired: "Is this possible?” Geller replied: "Well, we’ll try/’ The follow¬ ing morning, in the corner of his enormous office, we saw a writing desk, and on it — a chessboard and pieces, pens and clean sheets of paper. Alongside, on a trolley, were bottles of mineral water and caviar sandwiches. As soon as Geller and I sat down to analyse, Ivonin said in a business¬ like way: "Well, everything seems to be in order. I won’t disturb you.” And he went out, locking the door behind him... The analysis took us the whole of the working day. That was how the idea 13 <5ie4!? was born. I wrote all our variations on the sheets of paper and handed them to Ivonin../ Zaitsev: 'In the 14th game there occurred one of the two venomous, although transi¬ tory novelties in the Open Variation of the Spanish, which decided the outcome of the match. That day an interesting idea of Geller was used, one that he had discovered to¬ gether with Razuvaev — 13 ^e4!? True, in order to decipher the notes, hand-written on sheets of paper, and present this discovery to Karpov in a suitable form, I had to sacri¬ fice a desirable trip to Venice, which our entire delegation visited during a three-day break.’ 373 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Game 85 A.

(Sax-Tal, Tallinn 1979) sets Black any serious problems. 12.. .£texd4 13 ^e4 This is one of those novelties which helped to break the resistance of Korchnoi, who was on the point of ‘reviving’. The effect of such surprises is very strong, since in the course of the match it is hard for the opponent to find a worthy antidote. Then he has to change his main opening, and the reserve one may not always be equivalent in terms of quality and degree of preparedness. Usually 13 4ixd4 ttxd4 was played, for ex¬ ample: 14 We2 Bd8 15 a4 H?d5! 16 axb5 axb5 17 Wc4 (not 17 fia5? ±b4! 18 Bxb5 £kl4) 17..Jtc5 18 Wxd5 Bxd5 with an excellent endgame for Black (Adams-Anand, 2nd matchgame, Linares 1994).

I managed to beat this dubious achievement, when in the opening of the 2nd game of my match with Karpov in Seville (1987) I thought for 83 minutes! On encountering another surprise, Korchnoi preferred to make the move that was most useful, even on general grounds. The other typical manoeuvre 13...Wd5P! was rightly condemned by Karpov: after 14 £}xd4 £>xd4 15 £>c3 Wd7 16 &c3 &c5 17 Wh5 or 14.. .#xe4 15 ^xe6 fxe6 16 fT5+ g6 17 Wh3 White firmly seizes the initiative. 14 JLe3 £}xf3+? 374 Anatoly the Twelfth Essentially the only mistake in the game, but at the same time an irreparable one. One can't help remembering the 2nd game of their 1974 match and Korchnoi’s losing move 19...fi4c5? immediately after an opening nov¬ elty by the opponent (Game No.67). It is obvious that the knight cannot be maintained in the centre: 14...c5 15 b4! (with the sequel 15...£htEH- 16 Hfx£3 c4 17 Hfdl Wc8 18 £>d6+ ±xd6 19 exd6 0-0 20 d7). However, its exchange is also bad, merely as¬ sisting the rapid activation of the white forces. In his next ‘black’ game Korchnoi found the correct way — 14...^if5! 15 Wc2 0-0.

Karpov hesi¬ tated for a long time before making his choice, since he wanted to keep his rook on the f-file and advance his f2-pawn.

However, other queen moves — 17 Had Hd8 18 <$M6 Jtxd6 19 exd6 or 16...Hb8 17 Wg4 c5 18 f4 Wcl 19 <5id6 — also lead to situations where hopes of saving the game are associated only with a possible mistake by the opponent. 17 £if6+! jtxf6 The consequences of 17...gxf6? 18 exf6 JLd6 19 Hd4! followed by 20 Hh4 are too transparent. 18 exf6 Wc8 19 fxg7 For the moment there is no crushing attack - 19 Wg3 Hd8 20 f4? g6 21 f5 £rf8, and Kar¬ pov chooses a continuation which in the end 375 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors leaves White a pawn up. 19.. .5d8 Of course, not 19...<A>xg7? 20 .&h6+!

The win¬ ner criticises himself, thinking that ‘the pro¬ phylactic move 20 b4 should have been con¬ sidered, so as to halt all Black’s play and in the end force him to take the g-pawn, exposing his king.’ 20.. .c5 21 lacl ‘Technically the strongest solution was 21 2xd8+ 1IM8 22 Sdl £>d4 23 ±xd4 cxd4 24 We4!, and the h-pawn advances unhindered.’ (Karpov) 21...#c7 22 h5 ‘Engrossed in my idea, I allow the oppo¬ nent to activate his pieces at last and to gain counterplay,’ writes Karpov. ‘I should have continued 22 1fff6!

Black’s helplessness is absolute — such is the strength of the protected g7-pawn. 36 g4! 2d5 37 gxf5 fixf5 38 2d2 2f6 39 2d7+ *g8 40 fB! The h6-pawn must be retained. Although after 40 He7?! Hg6+ 41 <4>f2 Sxh6 42 £5 Bf6 43 Bxe6 Hxf5+ 44 <4>e2 Si?xg7 White is a bishop up, it does not control the queening square of the last white pawn. Thanks to the rooks being still on the board, White should win, but the game could have dragged out. 40...2xf5 41 2e7 The remaining moves need not have been made, but Korchnoi did not want to hear the applause in honour of the winner. 41 ...4^xg7 42 Bxg7 + ^h8 43 2c7 4?g8 44 ±xcb 2g5+ 45 4?f2 2g6 46 A,e3 Black sealed the secret move 46...Ba6, but the following day he resigned (1-0) without resuming. The score became 5-2. Zaitsev: Tlie fact that the end of the match was now close was eloquendy indicated by the 15th game, in which, by a clever and unexpected bishop sac¬ rifice, Korchnoi won a pawn in a position with heavy pieces and opposite-coloured bishops. But the way he chose to convert the advantage proved too simplifying, and did not pose Karpov any great problems. 20 2c5 ‘Even during the game it seemed to us that the immediate 20 exd4 was stronger, and if 20.. .J*xd4 - 21 Ec5!

White should probably not have hurried with this move: after 21 exd4 Ed8 (21...fiac8, recommended by Korchnoi in Informator, is no better) he could have tried to break up his opponent’s defences by 22 Ba5!? In the event of the straightforward 22...b6?l 23 Sd5 White’s chances are improved in view of the weakening of the c6-square.

One could cite 378 Anatoly the Twelfth several modem examples, where with this bal¬ ance of material the stronger side was able to create considerable difficulties for his oppo¬ nent’ The next two games also produced draws. Tal: CI was not even very concerned about what score Karpov won by. The only thing, I thought, was that he should not repeat the mistakes of Baguio. He did not repeat them. It is true that at several points the match scores coincided, but at that the analogies with Ba¬ guio concluded. And when with the score standing at 5-2 he made three draws, I didn’t worry, since not once was Karpov in serious danger of losing. And by the 18th game all the objective data, including my “inner voice”, pointed to the fact that it was time for the match to end.’ Game 86 A.Karpov-V.Korchnoi World Championship Match, Merano 1981,18 th game Ruj Lope% C80 1 e4 e5 2 £if3 £ic6 3 ±b5 a6 4 J,a4 *hf6 5 0-0 ®xe4 6 d4 b5 7 ±b3 d5 8 dxe5 Ae6 9 ^bd2 £ic5 10 c3 d4 11 Axe6 £ixe6 12 cxd4 £icxd4 13 a4! This suggestion was made by Polugayevsky. ‘Here everything was much simpler: the au¬ thor of the idea was in Merano and he himself was able to put it into an appropriate form.’ (Zaitsev). A joint analysis showed that there were just as many dangerous pitfalls here for Black, as after 13 <§3e4 (Game No.85). And despite the fact that the opponent had not yet solved all his opening problems after the knight move, it was decided to test his reaction to another novelty. The effect ex¬ ceeded all expectations! Korchnoi thought for 54 minutes over his reply and did not choose the best plan of defence. 13.. .±e7?l Present-day practice has sifted out both 13.. .jte7 and 13..JSb8. In the latter case the endgame arising after 14 axb5 axb5 15 <53e4 Jte7 16 ±e3 <53f5 17 Aa7 #xdl 18 tfkdl fld8 19 g4 Bxdl+ 20 Hxdl is difficult for Black, for example: 20...^3h4 21 4ixh4 Jtxh4 22 Jte3 (Smirin-Hubner, Polanica Zdroj 1995), or 20...4^h6 21 h3 f5 22 exf6 gxf6 23 Jte3 (C.Hansen-I.Sokolov, Malmo 1997). For a time 13...itc5 was considered best. After 14 Ab6 White has a fair choice, but the most promising is probably 15 ^fg5!P Good chances of equalising are given by 14.. .0.0 15 ^ixc5 5ixf3+ 16 WxQ ?ixc5 17 axb5 axb5 18 JLgS. This position was consid¬ ered clearly better for White, until Black re¬ sorted to the radical measure of sacrificing his queen — 18...ttxal 19 Jtxd8 S.xfl+ 20 Sfexfl Sxd8. This occurred, in particular, in the game Topalov-Anand (Dos Hermanas 1996), where after 21 g3 (not 21 Wc6 22 WxbSP? Hdl+ 23 <4>e2 ^d4+) 21 ...£>e6 22 ®b7 g6 23 Wxb5 c5 24 h4 h5 Black set up a seemingly impregnable fortress. But later, in the 21st century, after 14 ^e4 he only replied 14.. .Jtb6. The question suggests itself: is the fortress really impregnable? Nowadays 13...Jtb4 has come to the fore¬ front, although in the game Kramnik-Shirov (Monaco rapidplay 2005) Black quickly ended up in a difficult position: 14 axb5 ^xf3+? 15 4tfxf3 axb5 16 Hxa8 Wxa8 17 ^g5! Also, 14.. .axb5? 15 ttxa8 Wxa8 16 ^xd4 ^xd4 17 Wg4 is bad for him. Therefore 14...4tkb5 is played, but after 15 £}e4 0-0 16 Jle3 (Shirov- 379 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors / Anand, Mainz rapidplay 2004) or 15 ®a4 Jte7 16 £k4 (Svidler-LSokolov, Wijk aan Zee 2005) Black encounters certain difficulties. It has to be said that modem practice does not offer an absolutely reliable prescription against 13 a4! 14 £ixd4 £ixd4 After making several attempts to defend the position after 14...®xd4 15 axb5 IlfxeS 16 bxa6 0-0 17 ®a4, Black has remained dissatis¬ fied with the results: 1) 17..JLfb8 18 a7 lb7 19 &£3 WdS (or 19 .J®b5 20 Wxb5 Ixb5 21 ±e3 ±f6 22 Ia2 Hjartarson-Smejkal, Bundesliga 1989) 20 Jte3 ix5 21 Hadl Wb3 22 Wxb3 flxb3 23 ±xc5 4^xc5 24 £>d4 (Ehlvest-Marin, Tallinn 1989); 2) 17...&C5 18 Wc4 Hfb8 19 fia5 ltd6 20 £>e4 £\xe4 21 Hfxe4 Wb4 22 Hfxb4 Jtxb4 23 Sa4 Sb6 24 a7 «&,c5 25 Hdl (Topalov- Korchnoi, Madrid 1996). It would appear that Korchnoi could have saved this endgame by playing 25...flb7 (26 Jte3 Jhce3 27 fxe3 ^fS), but also White’s advantage could have become tangible in the event of 19 £if3! Wc6 20 Wxe6 fxe6 21 a7 flb7 22 £ld4 or 22 Ae3. 15£ie4 This thematic move 'secures White a solid advantage both with the queens on, and after their exchange.’ (Karpov) 15...^e6? The knight cannot be maintained in the centre. Korchnoi did not want to move it away from the kingside, but at e6 its position is insecure. 15...0-0 16 axb5 £)xb5 17 Ae3 Wc8 was nevertheless better — the knight, pro¬ tected by the a6-pawn, would itself defend the other pawn island, and the queen, after mov¬ ing to e6 or £5, would hinder the development of White’s attack. At one time such a set-up was practised by Yusupov, who is famed for his tenacity in de¬ fence. He had problems in three games from 1989 — with Ivanchuk (Linares), Adams and Chandler (both Hastings), and did not find any followers. In the variation 13...Jlb4 14 axb5 4fxb5 (cf. above) positions with a similar pattern arise, but with the knights on £3 and e6 — there it is easier for Black to defend. 16±e3 0-0 17f4#xd1 If 17...g6 Karpov was ready to play 18 g4l, ensuring the advance fikf5. 18 fifxdl As a result of his badly played opening, Black has ended up in a difficult position without a hint of counterplay. 18.. .5fb8?! Black’s hopes of activating his rooks are not destined to be realised, whereas the ap¬ pearance of a white rook on the 7th rank makes a catastrophe inevitable. The 'resolute’ 18.. .5 19 exf6 JbcfiS (or 19...gx£6 20 f5 £sg7 21 g4) 20 £)xf6+ (20 f5 ±xb2 21 fke6 JLxal 22 fixal followed by 4bc5 is perhaps even stronger) 20...gxf6 21 f5 4lg7 22 g4 looks very unattractive. The best chance was to simplify by 18...fifd8 19 axb5 axb5 20 fixa8 fixa8 21 380 Anatoly the Twelfth f5 fid8 (21...£)f8 22 ficl! fia4? 23 £>c3) 22 Hxd8+ (22 ficl £ld4) 22...£kd8. Despite White’s obvious superiority, Black could have hoped to save the game, thanks to the limited material remaining. 19Sd7±f8 ‘19...1.d8 was more tenacious, although even in this case after 20 a5 £if8 21 Sd3 Black’s position is far from pleasant.’ (Kar¬ pov). Indeed, despite the material equality, the disharmony in the placing of Black’s pieces and his bad pawn structure make his position objectively lost 20 f5 ®d8 21 a5! The pawn capture 21 fixc7 (which is what, evidendy, Korchnoi was hoping for) would have allowed the rook to become active: 21.. .bxa4 22 ±d4 flb4 23 fidl (Keene) 23.. .5b7 (pointed out by Karpov) 24 JIxb7 $ixb7 25 fial a3 26 bxa3 Sd8. By postponing the winning of material, with consistent play the world champion denies his opponent the slightest chance. 21.. .4bc6 22 e6! fxe6 23 f6! Powerful play. Tt would seem that Korchnoi underestimated this move when he played 19..Jtf8.’ (Karpov). I think that Korchnoi underestimated the whole series of White’s last few moves, when he placed his rook on b8. 23.. .£}e5 It is possible to lure the rook off the 7th rank, but at too high a price: 23...fid8 24 Hxc7 Hac8 25 f7+ <A)h8 26 Sxc8 flxc8 27 Scl (Karpov) 27...£te7 28 Sxc8 £\xc8 29 £\c5, and a piece has to be given up for the f7- pawn.

There is no reason to hurry. This move se¬ cures a quiet refuge for the king.’ (Karpov). I relate differendy to chess time in general and to prophylaxis in particular. This is evidendy why our chess styles are so dissimilar. 27.. .H6 This is not prophylaxis in return — Black simply has no useful moves. He also loses after 27...Hd7 28 2c8 fldl+ 29 <&>f2 gxf6 30 £ixf6+ *4>g7 31 $ixh7 or 31 sfee2. 28 fia7! (undoubtedly the clearest way of converting the advantage) 28.. .4bc4 Neither now, nor later, can the rook leave the 8th rank, on account of major losses: 28.. .5dl+ 29 <A>f2 2bl 30 kd4 £>c6 31 f7+ 4)h7 32 fia8 ^hxd4 33 Sxf8 fixb2+ 34 ^Pgl ttbl+35^h2lfl 36 2d8. 29 Ab6\ 2b8 30 Ac5 ±xc5+ 31 £ixc5 gxf6 32 b4! A technically accurate decision. For an in¬ stant Black is a pawn up, but his position is still absolutely hopeless. This was the right 381 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors time to resign, but Korchnoi, as in the last game in Baguio, wanted to hold out until the adjournment The remainder is clear without any commentary. 32...Sd8 33 Sxa6 <4>f7 34 la7+ <4>g6 35 ld7!

But, as was expected, there was no adjournment session. Two hours before it was due to begin. Black resigned (1-0), and the match concluded with the score 6-2 (plus 10 draws) in Karpov’s favour. Baturinsky remembers that Korchnoi first sent Klein a hand-written note in English: T inform you that I am resigning the 18th game and the entire match, and I congratulate Kar¬ pov and the entire Soviet delegation on their excellent electronic technology. Korchnoi.’ As is evident, the challenger sincerely believed that the cause of his defeat was the effect of mysterious electronic rays. However, when a few hours later Baturinsky asked Klein to make a photocopy of this note, the latter laughingly replied: It doesn’t exist!’ Here is a present-day summary by Zaitsev: It appears that it was these concluding sal¬ voes, fired at the Open Variation, which brought Karpov victory in the match. For¬ mally that is so, but in my opinion the main reason for Korchnoi’s defeat w#s that he was excessively carried away by set-ups where the strategic situation in the centre was deter¬ mined too early. As a very strong strategist, he should possibly have directed all his efforts towards seeking (or, in the end, discovering) set-ups where for quite a long time a strategic (not positional, but strategic!) struggle would have been maintained. That is, a struggle for control over the processes of structure forma¬ tion. A prompt for Korchnoi could have been provided, at the least, by two of his old wins over Karpov - in Hastings (1971/72) and in the 19th game of their Moscow match (1974), where a compact queen’s pawn opening was played. Later such a course was quite deliber¬ ately and not unsuccessfully chosen against Karpov by other match opponents — Yusupov (1989) and Anand (1998).’ The opinions of well-known grandmasters, expressed immediately after the match, are also interesting in their own way. Polugayevsky. 1 sensed the mood of the world champion — not only to win the match, but to gain a convincing victory. He ap¬ proached the event professionally, in the best sense of the word.’ Geller: ‘The fifth hour of play, which is es¬ pecially difficult for players, was completely Karpov’s. He managed practically without any time-troubles and, above all, he did not permit himself the premature inner demobilisation, which more than once let him down in Ba¬ guio. The world champion also won the theo¬ retical duel. His practical and analytical work proved very accurately balanced.’ Gligoric: Hhe quality of play in Merano was much higher — far fewer mistakes, than in many other similar matches. Karpov played excellendy, and he now has no equals, there¬ fore there is no point in judging his oppo¬ nent’s play too severely. The match provided some exceptionally important conclusions for opening theory.’ Schmid: ‘Karpov is an outstanding phe¬ nomenon. But apart from his exceptional tal- 382 Anatoly the Twelfth ent, which showed itself at an early age, he also needed excellent conditions in which it could develop. The present world champion is a universal player of the highest class/ Olafsson: A convincing win! We face three years for selecting Karpov’s future opponent, and at the moment it is not easy to say who will compete with him. Among the most probable contenders I would name Tunman, Kasparov, Korchnoi, and also Beliavsky and Balashov. One thing is certain: today Karpov is the strongest player in the world.’ Larsen: d predicted the 6-2 score a long time ago, and I was wrong only about the total number of games; I thought there would be 22. In all the post-war period there has been no other world championship match where the champion was so superior to the challenger. I think that the next contender for the crown will be Timman, or Beliavsky, or... Larsen. Kas¬ parov? When he sacrifices, he is always sure that he will win — he is too great an optimist!’ Najdorf: £I have to apologise to Karpov. Up till now I regarded him as an accurate chess worker. In Merano he showed himself to be a genius. That which he does can be compared with the play of Capablanca in the period of his greatest fame. I would place Anatoly among the best players in history.’ Nine years later, after cooling down some¬ what, even Korchnoi admitted in an interview that Karpov was a real world champion and that he had occupied a worthy place in chess history... Who's next? On the results of 1981, journalists awarded Karpov another — already the eighth! — chess ‘Oscar’, with his contemporary and long¬ standing rival Jan Timman in second place. And the Dutch grandmaster promptly con¬ firmed his strength, by brilliantly winning a strong tournament in Mar del Plata (February 1982): 1. Timman — 9Vz out of 13; 2. Portisch — 8; 3-5. Karpov, Polugayevsky and Seirawan — 7/4; 6. Andersson — 7, etc. Starting from the 3rd round, Timman scored eight successive winsQ, including one over Karpov — again with Black in a Sicilian Defence (cf. Game No.89, note to White’s 9th move). After such a spurt there was no ques¬ tion about the winner of the tournament. But what about the world champion? Polugayevsky: ‘The chess world is already accustomed to Karpov finishing only first. But it cannot be forgotten that little more than two months has passed since the match in Merano. All that time the champion has been literally ‘Bombarded” — he has had numerous meetings with chess fans, and he has been unable to rest properly. This told on his play: in a number of games he clearly failed to gain points that had already been earned, and after being close to a win against Palermo he even lost.. Although he still felt tired after the match for the crown, the world champion, in contrast to the overwhelming majority of his predecessors, nevertheless did not deviate from his principle: to participate in strong tournaments planned beforehand.’ There was indeed much to divert Karpov: with the blessing of the highest Party officials, he was ‘elected’ chairman of the Soviet Peace Fund (to the present day he is still the head of this transformed organisation). And at that time, as editor-in-chief of 64, the champion conducted a correspondence press conference for readers of the magazine, replying to their numerous questions. My attention was drawn to two of his statements. About his chess credo: d have heard many times how Botvinnik divides chess players into “researchers” and... those who include me. I will not argue with the esteemed Mikhail Moiseevich — after all, it is not a question of the name — but I firmly believe that my “non¬ researching activity” is not only liked by the chess world, but also benefits it. Incidentally, the greatest number of valuable chess inven¬ tions by Botvinnik relate to that time when he was playing intensively in competitions. And it is hard to count the losses suffered by chess, 383 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors during the years of the voluntary “sabbatical” of a grandmaster at the height of his powers/ About his future opponent and the pros¬ pects of the young — Kasparov, Psakhis, Yu- supov and Dolmatov: If we add to them the best of those in their thirties, we obtain the names of those who will contest the Candi¬ dates matches in the immediate future. And perhaps also participate in a match for the title of world champion... It is not yet clear whether Korchnoi will be able to recover after his crushing defeat in Merano, but for the moment he is the No.2 player in the world. True, I know a grandmaster who is capable of beating him. I think that if he qualifies for the Candidates matches and meets Korchnoi, he will win. That player is Timman/ Karpov found it difficult at the tournament in London (April 1982). At the start he missed winning chances in his game with Short, then he made three more draws and only in the 5th round did he gain his first win — over Mestel. Karpov: ‘As the local press wrote, in this game the “Dragon” was overcome with the aid of technique. Continuing the play on words, I would have added that this is quite natural: after all, you can’t take it with your bare hands/ There then followed three more draws, in¬ cluding one with Timman. Playing White, Karpov was eager to gain revenge for Mar del Plata and this time he gained an obvious ad¬ vantage in a Sicilian Defence. But after a number of inaccuracies he had, on the con¬ trary, to try and save the game: at the tourna¬ ment there were evening adjournment ses¬ sions, and the game went on for three succes¬ sive days! But generally speaking, Timman played unevenly in London — as Karpov said, ‘the uneven nature of this talented grandmas¬ ter’s performances is surprising, although it is already becoming almost customary.’ In the 9th round the champion finally gained a second win — again in a Dragon’, and over an expert on it, Tony Miles. Even in this variation Karpov sought ways that would en¬ able him to escape from sharp lines and criti¬ cal theoretical debates into simple technical positions, where what acquired decisive im¬ portance was his superiority in positional un¬ derstanding and his ability to arrange his pieces ‘properly’. This game is one of a series of his ‘Sicilian pianissimos’.

Even so, later experience showed that the opening of the h-file — 14 h5! b5 15 hxg6 fol¬ lowed by 15...hxg6 16 WgS!, 15...fxg6 16 g5!, or 15...b4 16 £id5! sets Black significantly more difficult problems. 14...ttxd2+ 15 Exd2 lxd5 Later the capture with the knight would be deemed safer: 15...^3xd5 16 exd5 (if 16 lxg7, then 16...£ie3 equalises) 16...1xd5! 17 lxg7 lxf3 18 Bh3 lxg4 19 Ig3 <4>xg7 20 Bxg4 (Dolmatov-Shirov, Klaipeda 1988). This end¬ game, where Black has three pawns for a bishop, is hard to evaluate. Dvoretsky, who 385 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors has made a detailed analysis of it, considers the two sides’ chances to be roughly equal, only instead of 20...f5 he recommends sticking to waiting tactics — for example, 20...fic7. It is hard for White to exploit the superiority of the bishop in an open position, if Black’s pawn structure is not weakened. 16 exd5 a6 17 JLe2 White has chances of gaining an advantage, thanks to the two bishops and the possibility of combining play on the kingside with a fur¬ ther bind. 17.. .£id7 Hoping, if White wants to retain the bishop by 18 Jte3, to create counterplay after 18.. .£ie5 19 h5 b5 20 b3 £id7.

Immediately emphasising the weakening of the b5-pawn. Polugayevsky: ‘If you study the play of Karpov and Fischer in the technical stage of the game, you can see that both of them, when playing White, had a liking for the light-squared bishop. Strangely enough, I con¬ sider the person to blame for Karpov growing fond of the light-squared bishop to be myselfl In the 4th game of our match, I had a very powerful knight against a useless bishop in an ending, but I contrived to lose this ill-fated game.’ (GameNo.54), 23.. .£ia4 Some commentators considered this to be the decisive mistake, but in fact it does not spoil anything, although it was simpler to play 23.. .axb4 24 Hxb4 (Karpov: ‘with advantage to White’) 24..JScb7: the weakness of the b5- pawn is balanced by the weakness of the d5- pawn, and White’s slight spatial advantage is neutralised by the impregnable position of the knight at c5. 24 bxa5! £ic3 25 ±f1 <4>f8 It was thought that after 25...Ha8 the bold raid of the king was very strong — 26 (4)b2 4^a4+ 27 4)b3 4^c5+ 28 4)b4 (Karpov).

' Here too Karpov’s playing manner is clearly seen: the prophylactic restriction of the opponent’s counterplay (16 b3, 19 Wei, 22 a5), the sudden transformation of one form of advantage into another (23 Jtxc5!) and the lightning transference of the knight to c6.

The games with Portisch and Georgadze reflect not only Karpov’s style, but also his playing philosophy, which is: to find the set¬ ups that are most unpleasant for the oppo¬ nent, enabling him to gain a slight strategic initiative with an absence of real counterplay. By also defeating Spassky in the last round (with Black in a Ruy Lopez), the world cham¬ pion worthily concluded the London tourna¬ ment: 1-2. Anders son and Karpov - 8V2 out of 13; 3. Seirawan — 8; 4-7. Ljubojevic, Por¬ tisch, Speelman and Timman — 7; 8-9. Miles and Spassky — 6V2; 10. Geller — 6, etc. The next major event was the super- tournament in Bugojno (May 1982), where Karpov had already twice celebrated success, but on this occasion he was not among the contestants. On the other hand, I, the 19-year- old USSR Champion, already among the five strongest players in the world, managed to force my way there. I have already described the difficulties that this entailed in my book Child of Change. I will remind you of the main details. Early in 19821 received personal invitations from the organisers of three super- tournaments — in London, Bugojno and Tu¬ rin. My trainer and I placed our choice on Bugojno. But when I spoke about this to Krogius (Baturinsky’s direct successor), the head of the Sports Committee’s chess admini¬ stration, he suggested to me... a run-of-the- mill tournament in Dortmund, which was four categories lower! To my question as to what this all meant, he replied with disarming di¬ rectness: We have a world champion, and we don’t need another one.’ And his boss Ivonin let slip in public: "The Sports Committee is doing everything in its power to prevent Kas¬ parov from meeting Karpov in this cycle.’ What was I to do? Making use of a short visit to Baku by Ivonin and the President of the Soviet Chess Federation Sevastyanov, I ap¬ pealed directly to them and to the Azerbaijan leader Geidar Aliev. And only then was I al¬ lowed to play in Bugojno. The outcome of this event involving the leading grandmasters in the world evoked thoughts about the coming storms at the chess summit: 1. Kasparov — 9V2 out of 13 (+6=7); 2-3. Ljubojevic and Polugayevsky — 8; 4-5. Hiibner and Spassky — IV2; 6-8. Anders- son, Larsen and Petrosian — 7; 9.Ivanovic — 6; 10. Timman — 5V2, etc. Whereas earlier I thought that Kasparov could become Kar¬ pov’s opponent no earlier than the next cycle, after Bugojno I am inclined to admit that this may possibly happen earlier,’ Botvinnik said in an interview. That autumn I also won the In¬ terzonal tournament in Moscow (+7=6), and at the Olympiad in Lucerne, substituting on board one for Karpov, I defeated Korchnoi in a very sharp struggle. 389 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors The champion too was not idle. In June he set off with his trainer Zaitsev to a strong double-round tournament in Turin. The par¬ ticipation of eight top-class grandmasters was planned, but at the last moment Timman withdrew, and after the first cycle, with a score of ‘plus one5, Hiibner too pulled out (al¬ though, in the words of Zaitsev, ‘he did not give anyone the impression of being seriously ill5). Karpov found it hard to get into his stride: he threw away an advantage against Andersson and unexpectedly lost to Ljubo- jevic... In turn, Portisch defeated Ljubojevic and joined the leading group. In this situation the next duel between Karpov and Portisch was of exceptional im¬ portance. Apparently remembering about London, the Hungarian grandmaster avoided l...c5 in favour of the Petroff Defence. Thus the two players began an unusual opening mini-match of three games, played over the course of six months in 1982. Here Karpov again made use of the stock of preparations remaining from his matches for the world crown, which ensured him an enormous ad¬ vantage at the board for a long time, even against the leading theoreticians in the world.

In the remaining games Karpov gained quite good revenge against Ljubojevic and made five draws, which sufficed for a share of first place: 1-2. Anders son and Karpov — 6 out of 11 (after deducting the plus against Hiib- ner); 3-4. Ljubojevic and Portisch — 5 Vi; 5. Spassky — 5, etc. ‘If it is borne in mind that only six months have passed since the conclusion of the battle in Merano, which took so much strength and energy, the results achieved by the world champion in the last two tournaments should be considered good. That, at any event, is my point of view as a trainer/ Igor Zaitsev wrote in 64. In July in Las Palmas the first of three In¬ terzonal tournaments was held, bringing suc¬ cess to Ribli and Smyslov, and failure to Pet¬ rosian, Timm an, Larsen and Psakhis. In Au¬ gust in Toluca, victory was shared by Portisch and Torre, leaving behind Spassky, Po- lugayevsky, Seirawan, Yusupov and Balashov. In September in Moscow it was Beliavsky and I who distinguished ourselves, ahead of Tal, Anders son and Geller. Together with Korchnoi and Hiibner, the finalists from the previous cycle, this made up the eight Candi¬ dates, who had to play a series of matches to determine the world champion’s next oppo¬ nent. In the meantime the champion, finally rested, apparently, after the ‘battles in Mer¬ ano’, convincingly won his fourth super- tournament in Tilburg (autumn 1982): 1. Kar¬ pov — IVz out of 11; 2. Timman — 7; 3-4. Andersson and Sosonko — 6V2; 5-6. Petrosian and Smyslov — 6, etc. It could have been even better, but after a splendid start — wins over Hiibner (the score of their meetings became +5=8), Petrosian (for the first time in his life!) and the new Candidate Torre — he unexpect¬ edly miscalculated and lost to Portisch from a practically winning position (cf. Game N0.88, note to Black’s 10th move). This strongly affected the final result, since I not only lost a point, but my mood, under¬ standably, was spoiled/ Karpov related in 64. ‘As expected, one of my main rivals in the fight for first place was Jan Timman. He is a very distinctive player, who is engaged in con¬ stant searchings both in opening theory, and in the middlegame. A strong grandmaster, it cannot be denied. But in the years of qualify¬ ing events, strange things happen with him. He apparently cannot cope with the feeling of responsibility, with the stresses that accom¬ pany these events, and he is unable to control his nerves. Thus in the last cycle he again per¬ formed badly in the Interzonal tournament. There is something unjust about a player per¬ forming splendidly for three years, but being unable to prepare for one tournament (or un¬ able to cope with the nervous stress), and be¬ ing eliminated from the world championship for another three years. Perhaps there is a case for players who have won several major tour¬ naments being given an additional right (or personal invitation) to participate in the Can¬ didates matches?’ The impression is that at that time the world champion was dreaming of meeting Timman in a match, and he greatly regretted that this did not happen. His individual score against one of the best western grandmasters at that time was +7—3=13. Later the Dutch¬ man, as though forgetting about the ‘nervous 393 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors stress’, played several times in the Candidates matches and twice got through to the final! By the start of the final Karpov-Timman match in 1990 the score had risen to +16-4=30. Moreover, the insatiable Karpov won both this match: 6Y2-2V2 (+4=5) and their next one, for the FIDE world championship (1993): I2V2-8V2 (+6—2=13). There is no doubt that Euwe’s highly talented successor could have been a real contender for the chess crown, had it not been for the solid wall of Soviet grand¬ masters headed by the two £Kas’... In November 1982 the Soviet cohort — Karpov, Kasparov, Polugayevsky and Be- liavsky, reserves Tal and Yusupov — crushed everyone at the World Olympiad in Lucerne: 1. USSR — 42V2 out of 56; 2. Czechoslovakia — 36; 3. USA — 35V2, etc. Karpov: £The objective was fulfilled surprisingly easily. It is extremely rare for all the players in a team to be simulta¬ neously in good form. We were able to vary our line-up at will.’ In the 14 rounds Karpov played eight games (+5=3) and I played eleven (+6=5). At that same time, with Soviet support, the organiser of the match in Baguio, Florencio Campomanes, was elected President of FIDE. Before the result of the vote was announced, a highly symbolic episode occurred. In a'tragic voice the chairman read out a note that had been handed to him: ‘I regret to inform you of the death of President Brezhnev. I would ask you all to stand and observe a minute’s silence in his memory.’ Immediately after this, in deathly silence, Campomanes’s victory was announced. It appeared that the chess world was mourning not Brezhnev’s departure, but its own future... The world champion’s next appearance was the super-tournament in Linares (February 1983): 1. Spassky — 6V2 out of 10; 2-3. Anders- son and Karpov — 6 (+2=8); 4-6. Miles, Sax and Yusupov — 5Vz (ahead of Geller, Hort, Timman, Seirawan and Larsen). Karpov played with great care and restraint, but on one occasion he made a brilliant combination — and won the prize for the best game in the tournament.

An attempt had to be made to stop him,’ writes Karpov. As is apparent from the above games with Hort, Dorfman and Spassky, when necessary Karpov would temporarily change his pre¬ dominantly prophylactic style, although he tried to interpret even the sharp variations of the Keres Attack in a strictly positional man¬ ner. 6...h6 (6...<$)}c6 — GameNo.50; 6...jte7 — Game No.71) 7 Igl The champion’s main move in the early 1980s (7 h4 — Game No. 83). 7..Ae7 Not long before this Black successfully tried 7...&C6 8 ±e3 g5!? 9 Wd2 4^e5 (9...^d7?! is questionable: 10 0-0-0 4tide5 11 jte2 a6 12 h4 Anand-Sax, Reggio Emilia 1988) 10 ±c2 £3g6! 11 0-0-0 a6... V2-V2 (Kar- 394 Anatoly the Twelfth pov-Spassky, Turin 1982). On this occasion he might have faced 9 h4l? (Zaitsev-A.Sokolov, Moscow 1983). But the game Karpov-Timman (Plovdiv 1983), played soon afterwards, went 8...a6 9 We2 (9 h4!?) 9...5kd4 10 ±xd4 e5 11 J.e3 jt,e6 12 h4, and after 12...g6!? 13 g5 hxg5 14 hxg5 £>h5 15 0-0-0 £>f4 16 jbf4 exf4 17 ^3d5 ±g7 Black managed to extinguish his opponent’s initiative. 8 JLe3 (avoiding 8 h4 d5!? 9 exd5 £>xd5 10 Jtb5+ <S?f8 with sharp play, Radulov-Sax, Vrsac 1975) 8...£lc6 After this game Sax switched to 8..,a6. 9 Wfe2 According to Karpov, the idea of this rather unusual move is that after 0-0-0 White wants to exploit the opposition of his rook and the black queen on the d-file.

Of course, an improvement had been prepared for the game with Sax. For example, 13 4ib5!? 4ib6! (Zaitsev) 14 Hfd2, and Black still has to find an acceptable defence. 10 h4 After 10 0-0-0 the consequences of the fol¬ lowing variation seemed to Karpov to be un¬ clear: 10...<53xd4 11 jLxd4 e5 12 jte3 Hc8 with the typical idea of ...fixc3! ‘Therefore in the first instance White sets in readiness the mechanism for driving the knight at f6 (g4-g5) from its important position/ 10.. .®xd4 11 Jtxd4 e5 12 Ae3 Ac6 (if 12..

But 13...£ih7! was much better, with the idea of stifling the opponent’s attacking pawn chain: after 14 h5 ±g5! 15 0-0-0 0-0, or 14 395 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 0-0-0 Jtxh4 15 ^b5 0-0 16 4ixd6 (16 ®xd6 Wz5l) 16...Wf6 and ...I[fd8 Black has a solid position. Karpov suggests the gambit 14 g5 hxg5 15 <2M5 ‘with a slight advantage to White’. Dvoretsky objects: ‘The pawn sacrifice is tempting, but it is not clear whether it is correct: 15...gxh4 16 fixg7 £if6 18 0-0-0 h3.’ I would add that also after 15...^f6 it is not at all easy, if at all possible, to demonstrate an advantage for White. 14 0-0-0 £>xe4 It is too late to deviate: if 14...0-0-0? White has the strong 15 ttc4 ^xe4 16 ^d5!

For example: 20...e2 21 gxh6! exdlW-l- 22 flxdl le4 (22...±f6 23 flgl) 23 fee4 lf6 24 fid6. 16.. .dxe4 17 lc4 Hf8 ‘The black rook occupies an awkward posi¬ tion, in which it remains to the end of the game. But 17...0-0 was bad due to 18 g5 hxg5 19 lxg5 with a very strong attack’ (Karpov): 19.. .1xg5+ 20 hxg5 and Wh3! 18ld5!? A spectacular positional exchange sacrifice, although 18 g5! hxg5 19 hxg5 suggests itself, for example: 19...®fb4? 20 g6! fxg6 21 Wxb4 lxb4 22 2xg6, or 20...®xb3 21 gxf7+ Sxf7 22 axb3, getting through to the g7-pawn. But here Karpov did not like ‘Black’s only chance —19...g6: it was not clear to me whether I should provoke this move.’ The situation is clarified by 20 Hhl!, a move pointed out by grandmaster Motylev: if 20...®b4? White wins immediately by 21 lxf7+! Bxf7 22 We6. Of course, 20...fld8 is essential, but then 21 Hxd8+ lxd8 22 Sdl! is strong. Roughly the same happens after the imme¬ diate 19...fld8 20 Sxd8+ lxd8 21 Idl! (21 c3 le7! is not so clear — Dvoretsky) 21...Ie7 22 a3!, when White has total domination: Black’s downfall is caused by his had’ king. 19...fic8 20 ld5 Hh4 21 lxc6+ flxc6 22 Wd5 Wd6 23 ®xe4 etc. is only slightly better. 18.. .1xd5 (Black has to take the exchange: if 18.. .Wc7, then 19 lb5!) 19 lxd5 Hd8!? ‘The natural move, but possibly not the best. After 19...th4 20 lxb7 #xb3 21 axb3 Hb8 the simplest is 22 lxe4.’ (Karpov) However, Dvoretsky recommends 21...A>d7! 396 Anatoly the Twelfth 22 Sdl + ^dS! 23 l.d5+ 4*6$ with drawing chances, but also a move earlier — 20 Wxb4!

Avoiding the exchange of the dark-squared bishops: 20 itxe4 1x5!, while if 20 Axb7?!, then not only 20...1x5 (Karpov) was possible, but also 20...!.xh4! (Dvoretsky). 20.. .!b4!

Also 22 g5!P hxg5 23 Sxg5 was very strong.’ (Dvoretsky) 22 !e2! "Of course, the light-squared bishop has to be retained. The consequences of 22 cxb4 were unclear: 22...bxc4 23 Wxc4.’ (Karpov). Indeed, after 23...®d5 (Dvoretsky) 24 Wxd5 (24 Wcl Bd7 with a draw or 24...£61?) 24.. .5xd5 25 l.xa7 <4>d7! it is rather White who would have had to think about how to draw. 22.. .1d6 23 ®d5! ‘There was no point in playing 23 l.xb5+, since after 23...<i?e7 the black rooks gain scope.’ (Karpov). And if 23 g5, then 23...b4! was possible (Dvoretsky). 23.. .*e7? The critical moment. 23...ttxc3+? 24 4?bl! #xb2+ 25 (S?xb2 ±a3+ 26 4>xa3 Sxd5 27 l,xa7 was bad for Black, but better chances of a defence were offered by 23...Wc7, after which White would have faced a difficult choice,’ writes Karpov, indicating two possi¬ bilities: 24 g5, provoking 24...Wxc3+?l 25 &bl, when White gains the c-file, or 24 !.xb5+ <A)e7 25 <i?c2 — ‘a useful prophylactic move’, although, according to Dvoretsky, after 25.. .flb8 26 Sdl (26 g5 WbT) 26...Sfd8 27 1x4 sfefB the outcome is unclear. Therefore, in my view, it is better to play 25 Wxe4 Sb8 26 1x4 fft>7 27 ®c2! Ifc8 28 Ub3, nevertheless retaining an advantage. In addition, Dvoretsky recommended 23.. .a6, and ‘after 24 Sdl Wc7 25 lfxe4 White would have retained sufficient compensation for the sacrificed exchange, but evidently not more.’ However, 24 ®c6+! is stronger: 24.. .*e7 25 Sdl Sd7 (not 25...#c7? 26 Sxd6, 25.. .1.xa2? 26 1x5 tktf 27 g5! or 25...f6? 26 *bl!

Then the world champion won the jubilee, 50th USSR Championship (Moscow, April 1983): 1. Karpov - 9^2 out of 15 (+5-1=9); 2. Tukmakov — 9; 3-4. Polugayevsky and Va- ganian — 8V2, etc. I did not take part in this tournament, since I had only just beaten Be- liavsky in our quarter-final Candidates match and I was preparing for the semi-final match with Korchnoi. This, the most important match of the en¬ tire cycle, which initially was wrecked by the Sports Committee on the orders of the Com¬ munist Party Central Committee and the KGB, as has already been described in some detail in the chapter ‘Farewell to the Dream’. 398 Anatoly the Twelfth Karpov took part in the Moscow negotiations with Campomanes, then invited me to his home, and we discussed the situation in pri¬ vate. He advised me to appeal to Aliev, then a Politburo member of the Communist Party Central Committee, and for his part he prom¬ ised to arrange a meeting with Zimyanin, the Secretary of the Central Committee. Somewhat later, when the FIDE President defaulted me for failing to appear in Pasadena, Karpov made a cautiously vague statement ‘Korchnoi has been awarded a win without playing, but his opponent failed to turn up for the match not because of his own caprice or illness, but as a result of attendant circum¬ stances, that is, for non-chess reasons.5 It is clear that whose who created these cir¬ cumstances and reasons were pursuing one aim: ‘doing everything5 to ensure that Kas¬ parov did not qualify to play Karpov. Did the champion himself participate in the intrigue? In his book Sesira mqya Krissa (Caissa is my Sister) Anatoly Evgenyevich categorically de¬ nies this, maintaining that, on the contrary, he did a great deal to ensure that these matches — mine with Korchnoi and Smyslov5s with Ribli — took place: ‘I wanted everything to be honest and done with a clear conscience. At that time Kasparov was not yet a serious rival to me. I saw all his weaknesses and I had no doubt that I would cope with him at the chessboard without par¬ ticular difficulty. This match was even in my interests: the earlier we met, the more crushing would be the score (and the course of the first match showed that this reckoning was cor¬ rect)... Wouldn’t you agree that this is a simple argument against all Kasparov’s fabrications about my villainous plans and actions?... I even had to fly to the Philippines: we all thought that in the interests of the affair it would do no harm to make use of my good relations with Campomanes. And this reckon¬ ing was justified.5 Karpov’s reasonable arguments have one flaw: they were put forward after the event, after the fourth of our matches. But then, in the summer of 1983, it was not at all clear on what such optimism by the champion could be based: I was winning all the competitions, one after another, I had already received my first chess ‘Oscar5 (and soon also the second), my rating was rising rapidly, and by the end of the year it was already higher than Karpov’s (the first time it had been exceeded during the entire post-Fischer decade!). And none of his ‘good relations with Campomanes5 would have helped, if at that historic moment Aliev’s political resources had proved inadequate. Not without reason did Smyslov later say to me: ‘Young man, if the history of our semi-final matches had occurred not in the summer of 1983, but somewhat earlier (i.e. before November 1982, when Brezhnev died, and Aliev became a mem¬ ber of the Politburo —G.K), we would never have met in the final.5 In August the world champion won a cate¬ gory 9 tournament in Hanover, after suffering a sensational defeat in the first round against the master Hartman (with White in a Keres Attack!) and then scoring eight wins with six draws: 1. Karpov — 11 out of 15; 2. Georgadze — 10/4; 3. Balashov — 10, etc. In September I won the super-tournament in Niksic — 11 out of 14, and in October Karpov in turn cele¬ brated his fifth triumph in Tilburg — 7 out of 11 (+3=8). By winning my long-suffering match with Korchnoi in December, and the final match against the evergreen Smyslov in April 1984,1 gave a conclusive reply to the question that had long been in the air, regarding who would be the world champion’s next opponent. That spring the champion quite confidently won two good tournaments — in Oslo (+3=6) and in London: 1. Karpov — 9 out of 13; 2-3. Chandler and Polugayevsky — 8; 4. Timman — IV2; 5-6. Ribli and Seirawan - 7; 7-8. Korchnoi and Vaganian — 6V2, etc. Here ‘for old times’ sake5 he defeated Korchnoi, who after the ending of the boycott again began playing in tournaments against Soviet grandmasters. 399 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors In June Karpov and I played in the long- awaited second match between the USSR and the Rest of the World. Our first three boards were known: Karpov, Kasparov and Po- lugayevsky. But our opponents, endeavouring to improve their result, cunningly changed their board order Korchnoi was dispatched to torment Polugayevsky, the impregnable Andersson ‘manned the goal’ against Karpov, and the experienced Timman was thrown against the ‘hot-tempered’ Kasparov. This plan only partially justified itself: Korchnoi did indeed beat Polugayevsky (+1=3, including a draw with the reserve Tukmakov), but Karpov and I defeated our opponents by the same score. Our team also won: 21-19. On 10th December 1984 in Moscow the unlimited Karpov-Kasparov match for the world championship began. In the 1st game the opening was... a Keres Attack! However, here I am forced to interrupt my account, since this will be the topic of Volume 7, which will be devoted to my matches with Karpov. Super-Final In July 1985, before our second match, Kar¬ pov won a double-round tournament in Am¬ sterdam with 7 out of 10 (+4=6), half a point ahead of Timman. Here he alternated between 1 e4 and 1 ^f3, and in the match with me — between 1 e4 and 1 d4. In the decisive 24th game, in which only a win would satisfy him, the world champion began with his favourite king’s pawn, and the very logic of the play in a complicated Sicilian demanded that he should expose his rear by g2-g4-g5. He held the initia¬ tive, but on the 23rd move he delayed, on the 36th move he made a time-trouble blunder — and he lost the match (11-13) and also his title. After the serious shock of not winning our first match and losing the second, another player would have required a lengthy period of rehabilitation, but Karpov brilliantly displayed his determination by immediately plunging into the thick of tournament battles, in order to attain optimal form for the forthcoming return match in 1986. Already in November he led the USSR team at the World Team Championship in Lucerne (+3=4), in January in Vienna he look part for the first time in 20 years in a ‘Swiss’, but a strong one (+3=6), in the spring he was easily victorious in Brussels (9 out of 11, 2 points ahead of Korchnoi and 2V2 ahead of Miles, Timman and Torre), and early in the summer he won a double-round super-tournament in Bugojno: 1. Karpov — 8V2 out of 14; 2-3. Ljubojevic and A.Sokolov — 7V2, etc. In Bugojno Karpov suffered his only defeat over a period of six months — against the new bright star of Soviet chess, Andrey Sokolov (with Black in a Ruy Lopez, Zaitsev Varia¬ tion). The rapid rise of Sokolov, a contempo¬ rary of mine and a pupil of the experienced Moscow trainer Vladimir Yurkov, indicated his enormous chess potential: world junior champion (1982), USSR Champion (1984), one of the winners of the Interzonal tourna¬ ment in Biel and the Candidates tournament in Montpellier (1985). Early in 1986 in the Candidates semi-final match he crushed Va- ganian 6-2, while in the other semi-final Artur Yusupov defeated Timman in excellent style — 6-3. The unprecedented marathon for the world championship arranged by FIDE (four matches over the course of forty months, the first being of 48 games!) gave rise to a serious problem, which Korchnoi had thought about on the eve of the 32nd game of the match in Baguio: the loser of a return match physically does not have time to take part in the next qualifying cycle. And FIDE found an extra¬ ordinary way out of the situation: the winner of the final Candidates match of the new cycle would gain the right to play not with the world champion, but with the loser of the return match, and only the winner of this ‘super¬ final’ would qualify for a match with the champion. In the autumn of 1986, at the same time as I was winning the dramatic return match 400 Anatoly the Twelfth against Karpov (I2V2-W/2), Sokolov and Yu- supov played what was perhaps an even more dramatic final Candidates match: towards the finish Artur was leading 6-4, but then he lost three games in a row! A draw in the last, 14th game summed up his suffering — 6 Vi-7 Vi. Au¬ drey confirmed his reputation as a ‘person without nerve’. After this prelude, the Karpov-Sokolov super-final match (Linares, February-March 1987) looked a highly intriguing event and was awaited with great interest Play was to the best of 14 games. This match is worthy dwelling on in detail, since with it a new stage in Karpov’s career effectively begins. When analysing matches for the world championship, we have seen many times how champions, after losing to younger, rising op¬ ponents, began to lose faith in themselves and ceased to be at the forefront of modem chess thinking. But with Karpov, by contrast, his failures in the matches of 1985 and 1986 only added to his motivation! Displaying a rare chess flexibility, he succeeded in completely readjusting and developing for himself a new playing method. Thanks to this, for another ten years the 12th world champion battled at the highest level, won a number of matches for the FIDE championship and gained a bril¬ liant victory in Linares (1994), which is rightly regarded as one of the most outstanding tour¬ nament triumphs in the history of chess. First of all, the results of the 1984-86 matches led to Karpov realising the need to change his opening repertoire. In principle he had already switched to 1 d4 in our return match, but it was the match with Sokolov which showed that his switch was conclusive. Apparently the ex-champion realised that it was too hard for him to maintain control over the situation in the sharp variations of the Si¬ cilian Defence (incidentally, Sokolov, like my¬ self, happily played the ‘Scheveningen’) and that the closed games were nevertheless closer to his tastes and more in keeping with his overall approach to chess. In addition, Karpov sprung a surprise with Black: starting with this match a solid place in his arsenal was taken by the Caro-Kann De¬ fence with 4...^d7 — a very sound weapon, which he was to use right up to the start of the 21st century (more details about this will be given in the next volume). In the 1st game after 1 e4 c6 by playing 2 c4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 exd5 Sf6 5 ^c3 £ixd5 6 Sf3 e6 7 d4 Sokolov obtained a position from the Semi-Tarrasch Defence to the Queen’s Gambit: 7...JLe7 (7...£k6 8 Ad3 Beliavsky-Karpov, Moscow 1986; cf. Volume 2, Game No.117) 8 ±c4 0-0 9 0-0 ^c6 10 fiel (one of Botvinnik’s tabiyas — Volume 2} Game N0J6) 10...a6 11 ±b3!? £>xc3 12 bxc3 b5 13 #d3, and White retained some initiative. The critical moment arose on the 25th move. 25 flc5?! Andrey later regretted that he did not play 25 £}e4! ‘with winning chances’. Then Black would have had to find the only move 25.. JSh5 and after 26 Wxg6! (26 4ig5 Jtd5 is unclear, as is 26 d5 Wxd5! 21 Hc5 Wxc5 28 £ixc5 Bxc5, as pointed out by Makarichev) 26.. .fxg6 27 £}f6+ <4)g7 28 4fxd7 Hxh4 29 Hc7 Jtd5 30 £}e5+ 4^8 31 £}xg6 he would still have had to fight for equality. 25.. .tfe7 26 Sxe6! #xf6! 27 lxf6 fld7, with a draw on the 36th move. Nevertheless, the course of the opening encounter appeared to confirm the opinion of many of the ex- 40/ Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors perts, that the match would prove a difficult test for Karpov. In the 2nd game Karpov chose a topical line of the Queen’s Indian Defence with 4 g3 (cf. Game No.90, note to White’s 19th move), which occurred several times in my matches with him. The game was adjourned in a bishop against knight ending that was slightly better for White. But the defence for Black was rather unpleasant — especially against Karpov! And at the end of the second time control Sokolov faltered. 56.. .£hce4?? ‘A draw would have been achieved by 56.. .^xa4 57 Jtd4 4^6 58 4b5 (nothing is given by 58 e5+ 4e6 59 h4 h6, intending ...g6- g5) 58...£)c5 59 jtxc5+ bxc5 60 h4 h6 61 4c4 4c6 62 e5 h5 63 4d3 4d7, and Black keeps the distant opposition.’ (Makarichev) 57 4b5 £ic5 58 Af8!!

The next three games ended in draws, and it appeared that Sokolov might still be able to show his worth closer to the end of the match. The 6th game was destined to become decisive.

And although experience has shown that the knight manoeuvre to d3 is not especially dangerous for Black, 12...Se8 denies White this choice (13®el? Aa3). 13 Sel c5 (following the 2nd game; the 4th went 13...jtd6, and White held some initia¬ tive) 14 Ae3 Abl 15 Ah3 cxd4 16 ±xd4 £f6 17 Sc2 AM 18 Sfl Aa6 19£ih4!? In the 2nd game Karpov decided to immediately vacate the d4-square for his knight - 19 Ab2. Instead of 19..

Karpov intends £^f5, which is associated not only with a potential threat to the g7- point, but also with the manoeuvre of the knight to e3 for an attack on the d5-pawn (lo and behold, the bishop will return to g2 with the same aim). 19.. .±f8 20 £}f5 ^e4 21 ^e3 By creating pressure on the isolated pawn, White maintains the position in a state of dy¬ namic balance. After 21 Jtb2 Jlc8 22 Wd4 f6 or 21 H?cl £^g5! 22 Jtg4 h5! the initiative would have passed to Black. 21.. .Wd6 22 tel Bad8 23 Hdl (White has carried out the intended regrouping...) 23.. .616.24 ±q2 £}g5 25 Wb2 £ih3+ 26 £}g5 But the opponent’s counterplay does not allow him to 'work on’ the isolated pawn. 27 *g1 Here Karpov had a difficult task to solve. For example, the attack 27 £}f5 Wxh2 28 Jtxg7 is parried by 28...d4! This breakthrough sets White unpleasant problems. After 29 £}h6+ 4>xg7 30 £}g4 there is the brilliant stroke 30..JSxe2! (Zaitsev looked at 30...'th5 31 Hxd4 Jta3 32 Wal when White wins; he also mentioned 30...Bxe2, but didn’t notice Black’s next move) 31 Bxe2 Jta3! — a refine¬ ment by the computer, forcing White to think about how to save the game (32 Wc2 HftiS 33 »f5 %6). 27.. .^h3+ 28 *f1 ^g5 29 h4!? Realising that, in a long match, a score of + 1 did not yet guarantee him anything, Kar¬ pov decided to sharpen the play. This move weakens the king, but analysis shows that the risk was not very great and that the ex¬ champion’s evaluation was correct, although he had to endure some anxious mopients when Sokolov launched an attack. 29.. .£}e4 30 £ig4 6 (the prelude to some stormy events; however, 30,..Wg6!P 31 £)e5 Wf5 would have maintained the considerable tension without any dangerous adventures) 31 ±h3 31 ..,Jta3!? 31../tg6 looks less committing, although after 32 £}e5 all the same a piece has to be sacrificed, if Black does not want to come under pressure (32...Wf6 33 £M3 Wh6 34 ltd). So, 32...^xg3+l? 33 fkg3 Wxg3. Nowin the event of 34 Wc3 th2 35 &g2 Bc8 36 HT3 he has a choice between a spectacular draw: 36..JSxc2 37 Wxf7+ 38 ®g8+! with perpetual check, and 36...Sxe5 37 JtxeS ®xe5 38 Hxc8 Jtxc8 — White picks up the d5- pawn, but Black has excellent compensation for the exchange. The immediate 34 Jtg2! is better for White, and after 34...!txh4 Black has three pawns for a knight — it is hard to give a more definite evaluation. 403 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors It is clear that Black’s attack was dangerous, although the wealth of tempting possibilities harboured the risk of him making the incor¬ rect choice, as in fact happened. 31...^.a3 is a very spectacular move, but at the end of the combinative storm White gained a slight ad¬ vantage in the endgame. 32 Wxa3 ±xe2+! 32...£kg3+? loses to 33 <4>g2!

In the resulting unusual position White has a material advan¬ tage, but his pieces are not coordinated, and therefore Black should manage to create ade¬ quate counterplay after, say, 39...a5. Karpov chose a clearer path. 33.. .®xg3+ 34 *g2 Wxe2 35 #c1! This excellent move was most probably underestimated by Sokolov. The queen not only defends the rook, but also eyes the king- side. Moreover, the black knight is forced to retreat to h5, because the leap into the centre 35.. .^e4 runs into the dagger-blows 36 ^h6+! gxh6 37 ®xh6 f6 38 Bgl! 35...£ih5 36 4>h2! The commentators considered 36 Wg5 ffedl 37 ^h6+ &f8 38 ±b2 g6 39 ±a3+ <4>g7 40 Jle7, concluding their evidence of a decisive advantage for Black with the move found by Polugayevsky, 40...®al!, which, like the entire preceding chain, the computer ‘finds’ instandy: 41 <S}f5+ ^h8 42 JLxd8 f6! 43 1Bfg4 We5. To complete the picture, it should be mentioned that 37 <S^f6+ 38 tfxh5 ®xh5 39 £\xh5 f6 40 £>g3 *g8 41 h5 *£7 leads to a position where, with an unusual balance of forces, the advantage is also with Black. 36.. .2.6 Black has to defend the 6th rank, since 36.. .f6 loses by force: 37 ^3h6+! gxh6 38 flgl+ <4>h8 39 ®xh6 fie5 40 Hg3! Hg8 41 ±g4! 37 ®d2 The exchange of queens is imminent, and the balance of forces is again unusual, White’s rook and two bishops being better than Black’s two rooks and two pawns. 37.. .®f3 37...f6? again loses to 38 <S^h6+! ^£8 39 JLb2!, while the position after 37...h6 38 Wxe2 flxe2 39 a4 does not gready differ from that reached in the game. ‘Forceful’ attempts to demonstrate the opposite — 39.,.Ke4 40 ^e3 g6 41 Jtg4 f5 42 Jk,f3 Hxh4+ 43 ^gl — may lead merely to increased difficulties for Black. 38 foe5 lff4+ 39 #xf4 £ixf4 With the exchange of queens, the tension of the struggle diminishes sharply and a stage of unhurried manoeuvring begins. Karpov is very skilful in such positions, and here too he seeks the slightest chances. For a long time, as in the 2nd game, Sokolov demonstrates tenac¬ ity and caution. 404 Anatoly the Twelfth 40 k&7 2d8 41 Abb £>e6 42 ±b2 a6 43 iLfl Ec8 44 2d2 d4 45 J.g2 £rt4 46 A13 d3 47 £>c4 2h6 48 *g3 £ie2+ 49 J.xe2 dxe2 50 2xe2 b5 51 <£e3 2e6 52 2d2 h5 53 *f4 2c7 54 2d5 f6 55 Aa3 55 Exh5 is hardly advisable — after 55...2d6 Black becomes active and regains the pawn. By playing his bishop to c5, on the contrary, Karpov restricts the activity of the black rooks, and then, after supporting his bishop by 57 b4, begins play on the queenside with the unexpected manoeuvre of his rook from d5 to al. 55...g6 56 Acb 4>f7 57 b4 *e8 58 2d1! 2d7 59 Sal! 2d2 White achieves the creation of a weakness at a6, but in return Black succeeds in activat¬ ing his rook. 60 *f3 4?f7 61 a4 bxa4 62 Sxa4 g5 63 2a3 *g6 64 *g2 64...gxh4?! Losing patience, Sokolov makes a step to¬ wards disaster. He thought that there were no particular dangers, and with this capture (transforming Black’s pawn chain into a ruin) he decided simply to reduce the number of white pawns, relying on the hypothetical pos¬ sibility of another exchange after ...a6-a5. For a time, a nominal but, alas, unreal equilibrium is established on the board. In the given situa¬ tion the rook and two minor pieces protected by pawns prove stronger than the two rooks and weak pawns, which need to be constantly guarded. 65 1 2c2 66 £>h2 2c4 67 £>f3 *f7 68 &h2 The seemingly more vigorous 68 4^d4 fie5 69 ^hc6 could have led almost by force — 69.. .2g5+ 70 <4>h2 2gxc5! 71 bxc5 2xc5 72 2xa6 2c2 73 <4>gl h3 74 f4 h2+ 75 <4>hl Sf2 — to a position where White, playing without his king, would be unlikely to be able to save his only pawn. For example: 76 2a4 h4 77 4W <A>g6 78 ^hbS 4>f5 79 ^d6+ <A>g4 80 £5+ <4>h3 81 fial <4>g4 82 Sdl <A>f4 83 Bd5 2e2. 68.. .2f4 69 *g2 2ee4?! It is strange that Sokolov does not repeat the position (perhaps in order to avoid 70 5M4?). He could hardly have been hoping that this trap would work: 70 2xa6?? h3+ 71 <4>g3 h4+. Karpov does not hurry and continues manoeuvring. 70 £>d2 Ee6 71 £>f1! 2g4+ 72 ^h3 2f4 73 2a2 Sf3+ 74 *g2 2d3 If the rook is kept on the 4th rank — 74.. .2f4, then after 75 f5 76 ^hdS 2g6+ 77 4?h2 Ifg4 78 Sal! 2g2+ 79 ^hl S2g5 80 §3cl the a6-pawn is lost 75 £>e3 st?g6 76 Sal f5?! (this advance merely makes the pawn more vulnerable) 77 *h2 f4 78 2g1 + &f7 79 ^g2! Beginning the gathering of the harvest. Ex¬ ploiting the fact that the bishop at c5 is de¬ fending the f2-pawn, White wins one of the pawns. 405 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 79.. .fic6 Black could have tried to confuse matters by 79...Bf6 80 £\xh4 4?e6, intending to attack the bishop with ...4^15 and to try and elimi¬ nate the queenside pawns (...a6-a5). But White wins by both 81 Bg8 4d5 82 fig5+ 4c4 83 Bxh5 Bd5 84 Bh7 a5 85 Bc7 Ba6 86 Af8+ 4d3 87 bxa5 idxa5 88 4h3, and 81 £>g6 Bd5 82 Bel+ 4f7 83 £le5+ 4g7 84 £>c4 4h6 85 4ib6 Bg5 86 £kl7 Bff5 87 Bal Bg6 88 £}b8, when the a6-pawn cannot be saved. 80 4}xf4Hf3 81 £ih3 The remainder can now be considered a matter of technique: Black does not gain any counterplay, and his weak h-pawns are doomed. 81.. .4*6 82 lei Hf5 83 Be4 a5 Sokolov has nevertheless succeeded in ex¬ changing the queenside pawns. But White’s sole remaining pawn is quite sufficient for victory. 84 Jte3! axb4 85 Sxb4 Ba6 86 lxh4 Baa5 87 Sc4 Sfb5 88 4g3 Ha8 89 4h4 lg8 90±g5+ 1-0 Of course, Sokolov could have played on, but he realised that it would be a futile waste of time. The match score became 4-2. But in the 10th game, where a complicated ending arose, he again fell under the inexora¬ ble Karpov ‘steam-roller’.

Top-class chess is not without its great anxi¬ ety, sufferings and perhaps even shocks. When on the staircase I bumped into Andrey, returning together with his trainer from the adjournment session of the 6th game, I thought how basically tragic sport can be. And yet Sokolov is one of the few who can endure a defeat comparatively easily.’ To all appearances, this game determined the outcome of the match. It is not easy to recover from such a blow of fate: you appear to be doing everything correcdy, you give your all, but the opponent coolly demonstrates that all your efforts are in vain... Andrey neverthe¬ less displayed courage, and the following three games were drawn after a tough fight. 12 We2 The 8th game went 12 Bel c5! 13 4g2 £>c6 14 Bel £kc3 15 JLxc3 Wdl 16 Wd3 Bac8 17 Ad2 h6 with equality. 12...®xc3 13 ±xc3 ®d7 14 4g2 £ic6 Not bad, but subsequently they came to prefer the immediate 14...c5 15 Shel We6 16 £}gl (Karpov’s idea, which became popular after this game) 16...^c6 17 dxc5 d4 18 iLd2 jtxc5, when the passed d-pawn gives Black splendid play. This occurred in the game Ag- destein-Karpov (2nd matchgame, Gorvik 1991), in which Black employed the most cor¬ rect move order and after 19 We4 Bfe8 20 f4 Bad8 21 £}f3 d3 22 £ig5 Wd5 he was excel- lendy placed. The point of the move chosen by Sokolov is to transfer the knight to an ideal blockading 406 Anatoly the Twelfth post at e6. Then Black will play ...c7-c5 in a more favourable situation. However, Karpov discloses certain defects in this plan with a subtle manoeuvre. 15 flhel £>d8 16 £>g1! (planning f2-f4, which emphasises the instability of the knight’s position at e6) 16...c5 This way is not without some strategic risk. White’s offensive could have been neutralised by 16...^e6 17 f4 g6 18 ^f3 fiae8, preparing the blockading ...f7-f5 with a perfectly accept¬ able game. 17 f4 cxd4 18 Axd4 Black has acquired a passed pawn, but it needs defending. Therefore he faces a struggle for equality. To some extent the scenario of this game resembles the 2nd and 6th games, where initially Sokolov defended well and cre¬ ated counter-chances, but then the tension got to him and he went wrong, which Karpov skilfully exploited. 18...@f5 19 Badl ±b4 20 Hfl £>e6 21 Wd3\ «xd3 Black was short of one tempo (-.g7-g6) for setting up a blockade on the light squares.

It was more cautious to restrict the oppo¬ nent’s possibilities by 23...g6.

He probably did not want to take any actions involving a reduction in the number of pawns and therefore demanding accurate cal¬ culation. But on this occasion was he not let down by his intuition? This move was condemned by most of the commentators, who considered 36 g5 hxg5+ 37 hxg5 to be stronger. Let us continue the analysis with the moves 37...a6 (waiting and covering the b5-square) and 37...Bbl (waiting and giving greater scope to the rook). 407 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Analysis diagram So, 37...a6 38 f6 gxf6 39 gxf6 Ac5 40 jla3! (the best defence — an attack on the white pawns that have moved onto dark squares!) 41 sl?f5 Sf2 42 e6 JLb2! 43 b4 (after 43 e7 a5 White is unable to strengthen his position) 43...b5 44 axb5 axb5 45 e7 Sfl 46 <%5 fl£2 47 Hb3 Acl+ 48 *£5 ±b2 - the draw is obvious.

Another resource — 40 £ib5 - does not prevent Black from carrying out roughly the same idea: 40...fifl+ 41 fif3 Sel 42 £ic7+ *d7 43 £lxd5 ±d4 or 42 £lxa7 <&>d7 43 £lb5 Jtgl 44 Sh3 2fl+ 45 ^g4 <4^6, and again the white pawns are vulnerable. But this does not exhaust the analysis of 36 g5. It is possible that the ‘logical’ 38 f6 is a mistake, whereas the unexpected 38 g6 gives a different picture: 37...a6 38 g6!P fxg6 39 fxg6 fig2 40 £ie6 Bxg6 41 £ic7+, or 37...fibl 38 g6!P fxg6 39 fxg6 figl 40 £ib5. By giving up his g-pawn, White intends to regain the a- and d-pawns, after which Black can rely only on the restricted amount of material. 36...a6 37 <4>f3 37.. .Ac5? In time-trouble both players begin making mistakes. Control of the g5-square (and, as it turns out, of d8!) was important, and therefore Black should have manoeuvred with his rook — 37.. .fih2. For example: 38 (38 <4,g3 fib2) 38.. .flh3+ (after 38...<4>d7 the pretty knight sacrifice 39 £\b8+! 4?c7 40 ^ixa6+ 4h7 41 Bxd5 4^6 42 Bd7 Jtg5 43 Sxf7 leads to a situation where the white pawns cannot be stopped) 39 4e2 Sh2+ 40 4e3 fih3+ (not 40..

Karpov does not venture 38 ^c6l - with minimal forces White quite unexpectedly cre¬ ates mating threats, which in combination with pawn breakthroughs promise a win! Analysts diagram 408 Anatoly the Twelfth Black has several possible replies: 1) the passive defence 38...Bf2+ 39 <ig3 Hb2 is breached by 40 g5! hxg5 41 Sxd5 Exb3+ 42 <bg4 Jle7 43 h6! gxh6 44 f6; 2) after 38...d4 39 g5! hxg5 40 b4!

Black regains the pawn but, as it turns out, only temporarily after 43 Ed6! Sxb3 44 £6! gxf6 45 Sxf6 Ub4 46 4?f3, and he is unable to combat the passed pawns that White will soon create. Since the time-trouble had not yet ended, it was now Sokolov’s turn to make a mistake. 38...d4?l This makes the defence much more diffi¬ cult After the waiting move 38..JSbl! the white rook is tied to the defence of the pawn, there are no mating threats against the black king, and the game is close to a draw: 39 4D>f4 Hfl+ 40 4?g3 Egl+ 41 £>g2 fibl 42 £>e3 Jtxe3 43 Sxe3 <4^7. 39 All in the same manner. As on the 36th move, Karpov avoids forcing events — 39 £6!? gxf6 40 exf6. Analysis diagram At first sight this continuation gives White good winning chances: 40...HM? 41 £}g3 <4)d7 (41..Jtd6 42 £}f5 ±e5 43 £>xh6 StxSS 44 £}f5 also leads to a difficult position) 42 g5i hxg5 43 h6 fib2 44 £}fl g4+ 45 <4>xg4 He2 (45...2g2+ 46 2g3 Se2 47 h7 Se8 48 <4f5 Sh8 49 Sg7 is no better) 46 b4! Jld6 (46...±xb4 47 fixd4+ ±d6 48 ®>g3) 47 2xd4, and Black can resign. Hopes are offered only by the rook end¬ game after 40...'4d7! 41 ^3xd4 Jtxd4 42 Hxd4+ 4?e6 43 Eb4 4?xf6 (or 43...b5!?, reduc¬ ing the material remaining on the board: 44 axb5 axb5 45 2xb5 ^xfb 46 b4 Sbl) 44 Sxb6+ 4?g5. By now continuing 45 a5, White obtains two connected passed pawns, but it would appear that Black is saved by a miracle in the form of 45...fi,a2! 46 b4 Sa4. To gain time, the rook stands as far away as possible from the white king, and after 47 <A>e4 4?xg4 409 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 48 ^d5 f5 49 <4>c5 *xh5 50 Sxa6 £4 Black creates saving counterplay. For example: 51 Hf6 &g5 52 Hf8 h5 53 4>b5 Sal 54 a6 (or 54 <4>a6 h4 55 b5 h3 56 flh8 <&g4 57 b6 <4>g3 58 b7 Hbl — the draw is obvious) 54...<A>g4!

Instead of 41 ^xd4 White can, of course, try the same breakthrough as after 40...fib 1, namely: 41 g5 hxg5 42 h6. But here Black deals with the h6-pawn without losing mate¬ rial: 42...g4+ 43 *£2 ffbl!

The sealed move, over which Karpov thought for nearly 20 minutes. 42.. .fib1 43£>d5! 43...fig 1? In his adjournment analysis Sokolov did not find a reliable method of defence, and he apparently went along to resume what he thought was a lost endgame. Karpov was of the same opinion. However, in fact the ad¬ journed position was most probably drawn! In 64 Igor Zaitsev disclosed the study-like way with which Karpov and his team (Zaitsev, Podgaets and Ubilava) were intending to con¬ clude the game after 43..which is un¬ doubtedly the best move. After a night-time and morning analysis they were planning 44 e7+! Jtxe7 45 4xd4 Hgl 46 4c4! Hxg4+ 47 4b5 ±d8 48 fic3 Hh4 49 4c6 fixh5 50 4d7 HxG 51 ^xb6! A pretty ‘winning stroke’. Karpov: ‘Since 51..Jtxb6 leads to an amusing mate after 52 fic8+, Black is forced to give up the exchange — 51. ..HG, and after 52 fixG Jtxb6 the unavoidable b3-b4 breakthrough is decisive.’ But let’s try sacrificing the bishop: 51...g5! 52 4xd8 g4 53 £ic4 h5 - and isn’t it now Black who is playing for a win here?! Therefore, in my view, 48 4c6! is stronger: 48.. .fih4 49 £lxb6 ±xb6 (49...fixh5 50 £id7+ 4g8 51 fie3) 50 4xb6 fixh5 51 4xa5, and White wins the pawn race: 51...g5 52 b4 g4 53 fifl g3 54 b5 HxG 55 figl fiG (55...flg5 56 4a6) 56 b6 fib3 57 4a6 h5 58 b7 h4 59 4a7 G 60 a5 f4 61 a6 G (61...h3 62 4a8!) 62 4>a8! f2 63 ficl g2 64 a7 etc. But here 48...fid4! is better: 49 ^xb6 Jte7 (49...jhs:b6 50 4xb6 fid5 51 b4 axb4 52 a5), trying to control the b4-square. This last variation suggests that the Karpov team’s ‘study’ also has an earlier defect. In¬ deed, instead of 47...itd8 it is more accurate to play the immediate 47...fid4! 48 4^xb6 Jtb4, and this blockade would appear to be impregnable. 44 4d3 fixg4?! 44...<&>f8 45 Hf4 fig3+ 46 4c4 d3 47 4c3 4e8, was somewhat more tenacious, although after 48 f6 or 48 e7! f6 49 He4 ±d6 50 4>d2 White is close to a win. 45 f6!

Black is not saved by either 45...£xe6 46 f7+ <£d7 (46...<4>f8 47 c7) 47 £kb6+ 4PC6 48 ^hc4, or the ‘tenacious’ 45.. .fig5 46 £k7+ <4>d8 47 e7+ 48 fxe7+ (i?xe7 (Karpov) 49 <i>xd4 fixh5 50 <$M5+. 410 Anatoly the Twelfth 45.. .±d6 46 £>xb6 Sg5 47 fxg7 lxg7 48 £>c4 ±b4 49 exf7+ lxf7 50 Sxf7 *xf7 51 £ie5+! *f6 52 £lc6 ±e1 53 <&xd4 ±b4 54 £lc6 ±e1 55 4>e2 ±c3 56 4>d3 ±e1 57 4>c4 <S?g5 58 ^xa5!

In the 11th game after 1 e4 c6, having de¬ spaired of gaining an advantage after 2 d4 d5 3 ^d2 dxe4 4 ^xt4 ^bdl (3rd, 5th and 7th games) or 3 e5 Jtf5 4 4^c3 e6 5 g4 Jtg6 6 &Sge2 c5 (9th), Sokolov followed their starting duel - 2 c4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 cxd5 £tf6 5 £ic3 ^xd5 6 <£tf3, but Karpov, taking into account his opponent’s condition, ‘changed tune’ - 6...£>xc3!? 7 bxc3 g6. And.., ‘aban¬ doning his unique competitive qualities as though they were no use, Sokolov replaced then with sheer passion. But in my opinion, to win against the 12th world champion by act¬ ing in this way is in principle impossible.’ (Makarichev). After 8 h4?! iLg7! 9 h5 4hc6 10 Hbl Wc7 11 ±a3?\ Af5 12 lb5 a6 13 lc5 *d7 14 Wb3 0-0 15 hxg6 hxg6 16 ±c4 ±f6! 17 d4 b5! 18 ±d5 ^a5 19 ttdl 4hb7! Black soon won the game, and with it the match: 7 Vi-3 Vi. ‘Andrey possesses a memorable attacking style, he splendidly and accurately calculates complicated variations, and he is adept at handling a dynamic endgame. Yet for the moment his style cannot be called universal, since there are a number of technical and ma- noeuvring-type positions, where he does not feel so confident as in sharp and complicated situations,’ wrote Igor Zaitsev in 64. £Our ob¬ jective consisted in avoiding the latter type of position, and in obtaining the former. For the greater part Karpov was able to hold his op¬ ponent at a distance, though not always, it is true. In the 6th game there were some real fireworks. Given the slightest carelessness, something similar could also have begun in the 11th. But in the majority of cases, things did not come to a close-range fight... Karpov’s play, his virtuoso technique and his ability to penetrate into the essence of the position, make a great impression.’ Both the score and the opening discussion were simply catastrophic for Sokolov: a com¬ plete rout! The great champion’s flexible, infil¬ trating manner of play proved an unresolvable mystery for Audrey. Unfortunately, he was subsequendy unable to learn fully the lessons from his match defeat and to correct his chess deficiencies. Gradually the results of this un¬ doubtedly talented grandmaster declined, and within a few years Sokolov had dropped out of the world elite. But Karpov emerged renewed from this match: there was both l...c6, and consolida¬ tion of the positions with 1 d4. Whereas in the 1970s he used to play the same Spanish tabiyas for both colours with identical success, now the Queen’s Indian with 4 g3 became ‘Karpov territory’, on which he felt more confident than anyone. It can safely be said that Kar¬ pov’s many years of subsequent success can be tied in with the fact that here with Black he could always neutralise the opponent’s advan¬ tage and, given the opportunity, launch a counterattack, while with White he was con¬ stantly seeking additional resources for devel¬ oping that meagre advantage, which White usually enjoys in the Queen’s Indian (an ac¬ count of this is given later: Game Nos.97-100). In our fourth match for the crown (Seville, October-December 1987) Karpov took the lead after I made a blunder during the resumption of the 23rd game, but then he cracked under the infernal tension of the con¬ cluding, 24th game. I managed to level the scores (12-12) and retain my tide. Now our disputes were deferred — at last! — for three years, and Karpov had to begin the qualifying process from the Candidates quarter-final match. 411 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Chasing two Birds ‘Anatoly Karpov’s fighting spirit is truly in¬ domitable!’ wrote the magazine Shakhmaty v SSSR in 1988. ‘Almost immediately after the match in Seville our illustrious grandmaster was victorious in Wijk aan Zee, he finished second in the Euwe Memorial (behind Short, whom he beat in their individual game), and finally he won the first stage of the Wodd Cup and received the prize for the best game of the tournament!’ The game in question was a win against Timman, then the third-rated player in the world — with White in a fashionable varia¬ tion of the Queen’s Gambit Accepted: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 e4 4 e5 £k!5 5 Jtxc4 <?3b6 6 ±d3 (6 Ab3 - Game No.48) 6...^c6 7 £>e2 Ag4 8 Ae3 etc. I should remind you that in 1988-89, apart from the usual FIDE Candidates cycle, for the first time the World Cup was contested — this was effectively a tournament championship of the planet, organised by the Grandmasters Association (GMA). The two-year cycle con¬ sisted of six super-tournaments at classical time limits: Brussels — Belfort — Reykjavik — Barcelona — Rotterdam — Skelleftea. The 25 strongest grandmasters took part — each played in four of the six tournaments, and the three best results were taken into account. It need hardly be said how sharply the intensity of chess life increased, and what a fierce ri¬ valry in the fight for this new prestigious tro¬ phy flared up between the 12th and 13th world champions! I did not take part in the first World Cup tournament in April, but in May we met in a four-player match-tournament in Amsterdam (1. Kasparov - 9 out of 12; 2. Karpov — 6V2; 3. Timman — SVi, etc.; my result against Karpov was +2—2), and in July — in the second stage of the World Cup in Belfort. Before our game in the penultimate round Karpov was two points behind me, but a successful novelty in the Griinfeld Defence, in the Zaitsev Varia¬ tion, which was a subject of dispute between us in both Seville, and Amsterdam (1 d4 <53f6 2 c4 g6 3 £lc3 d5 4 cxd5 ^3xd5 5 e4 4^xc3 6 bxc3 Jtg7 7 Jtc4 c5 8 ^3e2 <?3c6 9 jk,e3 0-0 10 0-0 JLg4 11 £3 <?3a5 12 Jlxf7+!? Hxf7 13 fxg4 flxfl+ 14 'iPxfl Wd6 etc.), enabled him to win and as a result to reduce the deficit: 1. Kas¬ parov — 1IV2 out of 15; 2. Karpov — IOV2, etc. That same summer, into the tight schedule of super-tournaments was wedged the 55th USSR Championship (Moscow 1988), the strongest for a long time — the last in history which brought together the entire cream of Soviet chess. Here too there was a tough bat¬ tle between Karpov and me for the title, al¬ though, of course, we also had other rivals. After eight rounds the leading group looked like this: Beliavsky and Salov — 5Vz; Karpov, Kasparov and Yusupov — 5. In the 9th round Salov defeated Beliavsky, while Karpov won a splendid game against Yusupov. V Game 92 A.

But with this move order Black can immediately solve the problem of his c8- bishop’s development. 412 Anatoly the Twelfth 7...g6 8 e4 Timman’s plan, first employed by him against Short (Belgrade 1987). 8 e3 Af5, as occurred in the well-known game Bobotsov- Petrosian (Volume 3, Game No.43), is too in¬ sipid. 8.. .£ixe4?! A new idea, which proves not altogether successful.

However, after 15...®f6 there is no way for White to strengthen his position significantly: 16 Wh6+ %7 17 Wh4 £3d7, or 16 %3 <4>g7 17 lael ^3a6. Of course, in these variations there are some dangers for Black, but nevertheless fewer than in the event of the quiet 13 Wh4+ 14 lfxd8 Ixd8 15 Axe6 fke6 16 0-0-0. The e6-pawn is weak, and after the approxi¬ mate 16...Id6 17 Zhg5 h6 18 £k4 Id7 19 thcS Ie7 20 Hhel the simation becomes ex¬ tremely unpleasant for him. 13<±>f1!

But Karpov reckons that — with the king at e7! — things will be more difficult for Black with the queens on. 14...®d7 (if 14...£k6?!, intending ...<5ic7, then 15 d5! cxd5 16 Wa3+ 4T6 17 Jlxa6 bxa6 18 ®c3+ <4e7 19 £kl4 is strong) 15 fiel Sae8 Black is obviously preparing to evacuate his king to the queenside, and White decides to make a breakthrough. 16 d5! Karpov spent more than 40 minutes con¬ sidering this sacrifice. He thought that this was the critical moment of the game: White obvi¬ ously has numerous tactical possibilities, but I was unable to unite them in a logical chain of moves. It was clear to me that for the devel¬ opment of the initiative I had to sacrifice my central pawn, but what next? And suddenly the realisation came to me: the weak dark squares in Black’s position are defended by his knight And then I immediately found a ma¬ noeuvre, the aim of which was to eliminate this knight.’ Nothing was given by the direct 16 Jtxe6 fxe6 17 Wa3+ on account of 17...4^18!

This is not simply an attack on the b2-pawn, but also a significant change in the queen’s role in the forthcoming struggle (in the game it was driven back to the pitiful square h6). Analysis diagram It is not at all obvious how White can ex¬ ploit the 'indecent’ position of Black’s king and his other pieces. After all, White’s king is also separating his rooks and hindering the reserves from coming into play: 1) 18 b4 a6 19 iLxd7 4^7 20 <§3e5+ 4e7 21 h4 d4!P 22 Wxd4 Sd8 23 fldl, and Black has seized the initiative; 2) 18 <?M4 Wxb2 19 a4 4f6 20 fff4+, and 20...4g7? 21 £ixe6+ fixed 22 fixe6 fxe6 23 ±xdl (23...®bl+ 24 4e2 #xhl? 25 #e5+) is bad for Black, but 20...

Kasparov and Karpov — 11 Vi out of 17 (+6=11); 3-4. Yusupov and Salov — 10, etc. The regulations stipulated an additional match of four games for the title of USSR Champion, but Karpov did not want to play it, and the Sports Com¬ mittee officials together with his arbiter col¬ leagues went along with him. As a result, champion’s medals were awarded to us both 475 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors (this is described in more detail in Volume 2, in the chapter about Botvinnik). In September in excellent style Karpov won a six-player super-tournament in Tilburg, on this occasion a double-round event — IOV2 out of 14 (+7=7), in which he finished two points ahead of Short and twice beat Timman. In November I fought alongside him for the So¬ viet team at the Olympiad in Thessaloniki, and we scored +7=3 and +6=4 respectively (1. USSR - 40V2 out of 56; 2-3. England and Hol¬ land - 34V2, etc.). Then with considerable difficulty I won the third stage of the World Cup (Reykjavik, Oc¬ tober 1988), and in the fourth (Barcelona, spring 1989) I shared lst-2nd places with Ljubojevic (but he came first on the tie-break). Karpov did not take part in these tourna¬ ments, but he had not lost hope of winning the World Cup. In passing he shared victory in the rapidplay championships of Europe and the world, staged by FIDE (1988), and early in 1989 in Seattle he won a short quarter-final Candidates match against Hjartarson (3V2-IV2) and finished second behind Ivanchuk in Linares. The fifth stage of the World Cup (Rotter¬ dam, June 1989) became probably the most dramatic tournament in Karpov’s chess biog¬ raphy. In order to catch up with me before the concluding battle in Skelleftea, he had to take 1st place, at the same time scoring at least 11 out of 15 against the best grandmasters. And the ex-world champion started with 5 out of 6, and later had 9Vi out of 12! He only needed to make three draws, but... his strength ran out. He suffered three defeats in a row — against Salov, Ljubojevic and Nunn — and conceded 1st place to Timman! At the closing ceremony the happy Dutchman called this result the best in his career. In the sixth tournament (Skelleftea, August- September 1989) Karpov could still have achieved overall success, if he had taken clear 1st place, scored 11 out of 15 (again!) and fin¬ ished a point ahead of me. We met as early as the 2nd round, and I completely outplayed him with Black in a King’s Indian Defence, but missed a win in my opponent’s severe time-trouble. Nikitin: This draw did both players a disservice.’ Even so we finished joint first, each scoring 9Vi out of 15. Our lead in points over the other contest¬ ants in the World Cup comprised almost a whole tournament: 1. Kasparov — 83 points; 2. Karpov — 81; 3. Salov — 68V2; 4. Ehlvest — 68; 5. Ljubojevic — 66V2; 6. Nunn — 65V2; 7-8. Be- liavsky and Short - 63V2; 9-10. Hiibner and Timman — 51Vr, 11. A.Sokolov — 57, etc. A summing-up of this unprecedented two-year race was given omthe pages of the magazine Shakbmaty v AiTR by Alexander Nikitin: ‘In this cycle it would seem that the genera¬ tion of the Fischer era made its farewell. Against their young colleagues it has become hard for the brilliant aces to compete — Korchnoi, Tal, Portisch, Spassky, but they performed quite worthily... It is doubtful whether they will all pass through the Swiss sieve, the almost lottery-like qualifier for the next World Cup — the years take their toll. And it can be expected that within a year a new generation will appear to compete with the Karpov generation and the Kasparov gen¬ eration. The brightest and most prepared for such a competition, in my view, are Ivanchuk, Lautier, Gelfand, Dreev, Anand and Akopian.’ In all these experiences, the most important one for Karpov was his Candidates semi-final match with Artur Yusupov (London, October 1989). Its outcome seemed predictable: Yusu¬ pov always found it hard playing against Kar¬ pov, and it was not clear how he would be able to change this tradition. But the match turned out to be very difficult for the ex¬ champion. As is apparent, what told was fa¬ tigue after the battles of the World Cup, and also the fact that Yusupov and his trainer, Mark Dvoretsky, did not stake too much on the World Cup tournaments, and managed to prepare well for the main test and to choose a reliable opening course. 416 Anatoly the Twelfth Following the fashion of those years, the match was the best of just eight games, with a new, six-hour time control: 40 moves in two moves, plus 20 in the next hour, and only then adjournment Apart from Igor Zaitsev and Mikhail Podgaets, Karpov was helped by the American grandmaster Ron Henley — also a sign of the times! In the 1st game Karpov with Black em¬ ployed a strong novelty in the Queen’s Indian Defence with 4 g3 Jta6 and obtained a com¬ fortable game — a draw on the 44th move. In the 2nd, after choosing the 4 Wc2 variation against the Nim20-Indian Defence, he unex¬ pectedly came under a powerful attack, but at the decisive moment Yusupov delayed. 23.. .e4? The general opinion was that 23...4M3! would have given Black every chance of win¬ ning. If 24 Wc3?!, then 24...e4! is now good (25 hxg4 fxg4 and wins). 24 J&.d5+ ih8 25 e4 does not help in view of 25...^xcl 26 hxg4 (26 ttxcl £>e3) 26...£kl3 27 %3 £tf4 28 fiael fxg4 and wins.

In reply Yusupov chose the sharp Samisch Variation and boldly sacrificed the exchange. The ex¬ champion played very strongly, and seized the initiative, but in a fierce time scramble genuine miracles began. Game 93 A.Yusupov-A. Karpov Candidates Match, London 1989, 3rd game 36.. .#e7?

After taking the lead, Karpov avoided the Nimzo-Indian Defence in the 4th game by playing 3 ^£3, but instead of a Queen’s Indian Defence Yusupov preferred to go into a Queen’s Gambit, where he chose not the then popular Makogonov-Bondarevsky Variation, but the old Lasker Defence. Karpov played uncertainly and conceded the initiative, but it all ended happily for him. In the 5th game, after playing poorly in a Queen’s Pawn Opening, Karpov almost man¬ aged to equalise, but in a time scramble Yusu¬ pov suddenly made a bold positional sacrifice of a bishop and gained a pretty win. This 418 Anatoly the Twelfth game was awarded a prize for the best in the two semi-final matches (which were played, incidentally, on the same stage; in the second match Timman defeated Speelman 41/2-31/2). After levelling the scores, Yusupov could have built on his success in the 6th game, which proved truly tragic for him. Again the Lasker Defence was played, and again Black seized the initiative, but at the very last mo¬ ment he missed a certain win. The normal explanation is simpler: Yusupov expends too much effort on a game, becomes tired and at the decisive moment it can hap¬ pen that he no longer sees anything. This defi¬ ciency of his also told earlier.’ In the 7th game a Queen’s Pawn Opening again occurred. On this occasion Karpov suc¬ cessfully solved his problems, but on the 24th and 25th moves he played inaccurately, and White seized the initiative. In the already cus¬ tomary time scramble he won a pawn, but a position with opposite-coloured bishops was reached. A draw was agreed on the 61st move — and the score became 3V2-3V2. And then, finally, came the 8th game — the last in 'normal time’. Game 94 A. Karpov-A.Yusupov Candidates Match, London 1989, 8th game Queen x Gambit D56 38.. .a3? 38...Sxh2 would have won easily, for ex¬ ample: 39 f5 Sf2+ 40 ^el 2xf5, or 39 2a6 Sf2+40^el Hxf4. 39 Sa6! 2f2+ 40 4?e1 a2 41 f5 4?d7 (or 41.. .1xh2 42 f6! etc.) 42 f6 4?e6 43 2a8! <£xd6 44 f7 2xf7 45 Sxa2 4>c5 46 Sa6 Y2-Y2 When after the match Dvoretsky was asked: £How do you explain that Yusupov more than once missed a win that seemed altogether close?’ the experienced trainer re¬ plied: 4A suspicious person would have attributed this to “Dr Zukhar”, the role of whom at this match was performed by Igor Akimov, a psy¬ chologist and at the same time a journalist, an old helper of Karpov (and the literacy editor of his book ‘Sestra moya Kaissa*— G.K). Throughout all the games Akimov sat in the front row of the balcony and stared incessantly at the players, i.e. he behaved as Zukhar once did in Baguio. 1 d4 £rf6 2 c4 e6 3 £tf3 d5 4 £>c3 ±e7 5 ±g5 0-0 6 e3 h6 7 iLh4 £ie4 8 i.xe7 #xe7 9 Bel On encountering the Lasker Defence for the third time, the ex-champion again makes a different choice. In the 4th game he played 9 1§c2, and in the 6th — 9 cxd5. 9...c6 10 jtd3 £ixc3 11 2xc3 dxc4 12 iLxc4 &d7 13 0-0 e5 419 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors A position from the Capablanca Variation has been reached (6..,<S3bd7 7 ficl c6 8 Jtd3 dxc4 9 i.xc4 £>d5 10 JLxe7 1tfxe7 11 0-0 5lxc3 12 Hxc3 e5), but with the pawn on h6. This is not simply an extra tempo, but also a weakening'of the castled position, and for White this gives the chance of an attack! The alternative is 13...b6 14 Jld3 c5. I played this against Smyslov in the 6th game of the final Candidates match (1984) and after 15 Jtb5 Hd8 I maintained the balance. Later 15 Jte4 Hb8 16 Wc2 or 16 Wa4, which maintain slight pressure, were considered more promis¬ ing, as, for example, in the games Kramnik- Kasparov (Las Palmas 1996) and Karpov- Yusupov (Dortmund 1997). 14 ±b3 exd4 14...fle8, maintaining the pawn tension in the centre, is also quite safe. After 15 d5 cxd5 16 ®xd5 <§3f6 several games, beginning with Nikolic-Yusupov (Belgrade 1989), reached one and the same position — 17 1^c5 <S3e4 18 Wxe7 Sxe7 19 Sc2 <S3g5 — and invariably ended in a draw. 15 exd4 15...£if6?! A serious inaccuracy. 15...fld8 was correct, as, for example, in the recent game Leitao- Morovic (Brazil 2003). By playing his knight to f8 and erecting in good time a screen at e6, Black safely neutralises the bishop at b3, which otherwise makes the black king very uncomfortable: 16 Hel Wd6 17 fice3 <S3f8 18 £k5 ±e6 19 Wh5 A,xb3 20 Sxb3 #c7, and Morovic succeeded in defending everything. 16 Sel #d6 17£te5£>d5 17..Jtf5?, as Benjamin played against me (Horgen 1994), is refuted by 18 ^xf7! I didn’t play this, overlooking that after 18...fixf7 19 Axf7+ *xf7 20 Wb3+ *f8 21 ttxb7 fib8 22 ®xa7 JSxb2 White wins by 23 JSxc6! ffxc6 24 Wa3+ etc. It was quite possible to radically eliminate the threats to the f7-point by 17...Jte6 18 Jlxe6 fxe6, although the isolated e6- and d4- pawns are not equivalent, and White’s position should be preferred — say, after 18 flg3 (Makanchev). 18 2g3 Now it has become apparent that the h6- pawn, while safeguarding the king against mate threats on the back rank, has itself been transformed into a target for attack. 18...H5 A questionable decision. 18...Jte6 19 Wd2 4?h8 was probably better. The rook manoeu¬ vre 20 fle4 jtf5 21 flh4 does not give any¬ thing serious: 21...flae8 (21..Jth7? 22 Hhg4 g5 23 Jtxd5 @xd5 24 2xg5! and wins), and after 22 2f3 ±g6 23 !.xd5 cxd5 (23...Wxd5? 24 flxh6+) White has to be satisfied merely with the greater activity of his pieces. 19Wh5 19...jLh7? A serious mistake, after which it is already difficult to save the game. 19...Ve6! was nec- 420 Anatoly the Twelfth essary, although such a move (into the line of fire of the bishop at b3 and rook at el) is hard to make. However, there is no direct refuta¬ tion. In the event of 20 JlxdS cxd5 21 £M3 Wf6 22 IB Black has a choice: either 22...g6 23 Wxh6 Wxd4 24 Sxf5 Wxd3 25 Sfe5 Wd4 26 h4 SLac8 27 Sle2 with the initiative for White in the heavy piece ending, or 22... Jtg6 23 Sxf6 ±xh5 24 2d6 ±g6 25 £\f4 2fe8! - in this endgame it is hard for White to exploit his advantage. 20 #g4! g5? Of course, 20...g6 21 h4 (Karpov) does not look very appealing, but now Black loses by force. 21 h4 f6 22 hxg5! The position is ripe for a decisive assault, and White only needs to choose the correct way. The dashing 22 Wh5 fxe5 23 hxg5 4^7 24 Jtxd5 cxd5 25 2xe5 was recommended by some commentators, with an attack, but after 23.. Jtg6 24 Wxh6 e4! 25 2xe4 2f7 White is in danger of coming to a standstill. 22.. .hxg5 Tn the event of 22...fxg5 the reply 23 f4! would have only gained in strength.’ (Karpov) 23 f4?! Here, in my view, Karpov missed a forced win — 23 2h3! This move was suggested along with 23 Wh5 and 23 4ttf3 ‘with interesting variations’. Today they are interesting perhaps only for the fact that the computer refutes the human. For example, after 23 4^f3 'AhS 24 fle6 Wdl 25 £ixg5 Sg8 the correct continua¬ tion is not 26 Sxf6? (Zaitsev) 26...Wxg4 27 flxg4 fixg5!, when Black wins, but 26 2xc6! Wxg4 27 ^f7+, and also in the variation 25.. .fxg5 26 #xg5 Hg8 27 We5+ Bg7 28 Sh6 We7 29 fixg7 ®xg7 30 Jtc2 Zaitsev over¬ looks a computer defence — 30...^f6! But all these are secondary details, since 23 Sh3! would have given White a decisive ad¬ vantage: 1) 23...fxe5 24 Sxh7! Wf6. In Karpov’s opinion, ‘thanks to this move Black holds on’ (in contrast to 24...‘A)xh7 25 Jtc2+), but this is not so — after 25 2xe5 1Sxf2+ 26 <4)h2 HT4+ 27 ^xf4 and Bxb7 it is time for him to resign; 2) 23...«fe7 24 See3! £xe5 25 Sxe5 Vf7 26 Wxg5+ ®g7 27 2xd5! cxd5 28 #xd5+ <A>h8 29 Jlc2 Sad8 30 Sxh7+!

This computer geometry demonstrates that Black is defenceless. 23.. .2ae8?! Yusupov misses the chance opportunity and takes play into a lost endgame. 23...Ah8 was recommended, in order to obtain a more fa¬ vourable version of this endgame: 24 fxg5 fxe5 25 g6 ®xg6 26 Hfxg6 Jtxg6 27 Bxg6 exd4. After this Zaitsev gave an interesting variation with zugzwang in the final position: 28 fie4 2f7 29 ±xd5 cxd5 30 flh4+ fih7 31 lxd4 Hd8 32 Ig5 flhd7 33 a3 a6 34 a4 b5 (?- G.K) 35 axb5 axb5 36 b4 and wins (this variation was also given later by Karpov), but after 34...a5 it is unclear whether White has a win. In my opinion, 24 Jk,xd5! cxd5 (24...Wxd5 25 £xg5! fxe5 26 g6) 25 4tkl3 is much stronger, when it is hard for Black to defend, for exam¬ ple: 25...flae8 26 flxe8 Sxe8 27 £xg5 fig8 28 Sh3 or 25...flg8 26 2e6 Wd7 27 f5 etc. Even so, 23...<4)h8 would have given better chances of resisting. 24 fxg5 fxe5 If 24...Jtf5 Karpov was planning a spec- 42 7 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors tacular queen sacrifice: 25 gxf6+!l Jtxg4 26 Ixg4+ *h8 27 &f7+ Hxf7 28 flxe8+ Hf8 29 £7! 30 fixf8+ WxfB 31 Sg8+, transposing into an easily won pawn endgame.

Not all of the subsequent moves should have been made, but Yusupov was apparently in a state of shock: this match which had gone so well was lost by him practically without a fight in the final game. 37 Bd6+ ih5 38 Bh7+ *g4 39 Hd4+ *f5 40 Sd5+ *g6 41 Sg7+ *xg7 42 fixg5+ *f6 43 Bb5 a6 44 Sb6+ *e7 45 ih2 *d7 46 *h3 ic7 47 Sb3 *d6 48 g4 ie5 49 ih4 if6 50 Bb6+ ig7 51 ih5 a5 52 fib7+ ig8 53 a4 1-0 Karpov won the match 4V2-3V2 and went through to the final. An interesting description of the winner was given in a post-match interview by Mark Dvoretsky: ‘I would single out three factors, the com¬ bination of which for a long time gave Karpov an appreciable advantage over the leading grandmasters in the world. Firstly, he was al¬ ways a brilliant intuitive player, he had a splendid feeling for the peculiarities of a posi¬ tion, and he played easily and confidently. Secondly, Karpov is an ideal player, a com¬ petitor. Previously he hardly ever lost his head, he knew what to do and when, where to take a risk; subtly sensing his opponent’s condition, he would find the continuations that were most unpleasant for him. Thirdly, in his time the long-standing world champion made use of the services of virtually all the leading grandmasters in the country — and this was of enormous benefit to him in the assimilation of theory. ‘Today the effect of these factors, which strongly distinguished Karpov among other players, has diminished somewhat. He no longer trusts his unique intuition, he spends much time in thought, and he gets into time- trouble. His previously impeccable playing mechanism also does not always operate: now Karpov’s decisions are affected sometimes by either fears, or tiredness, or something else. Finally, today the ex-world champion’s staff of trainers is considerably reduced.’ Nevertheless, in contrast to certain other stars of that time, which sparkled close to the chess summit and then faded, Karpov’s star burned with a powerful light for almost a whole decade more. Genre Crisis After his confident victory over Timman in the final Candidates match (Kuala-Lumpur, March 1990) the ex-champion stated: ‘With time, with age, I have to look for new stimuli for myself, to find the strength that is so nec¬ essary for a fight. But in this case I simply want to win against Kasparov.’ And our fifth 422 Anatoly the Twelfth match for the crown (New York/Lyon, Oc- tober-December 1990) was, as usual, a tough fight. For some reason Karpov temporarily avoided the Caro-Kann and replied to 1 e4 only with l...e5. Four zeroes in the open games predetermined his overall defeat (IIV2- 12V2). Karpov again had to begin the next quali¬ fying cycle from the Candidates quarter-final match. I well remember how during the drawing of lots, which took place in February 1991 at the opening of the tournament in Linares, he literally shone with happiness when he was paired with the 21-year-old Vishy Anand. For the first time a match op¬ ponent of Karpov was young enough to be his son! It seemed improbable that the very talented and promising, but still too young and inexperienced Indian grandmaster would be able to offer serious resistance to such a giant of world chess as Anatoly Karpov. In Linares, incidentally, both of them performed indifferendy (there it was another brilliant leader of the new generation who shone — Vasily Ivanchuk). But the match with Anand (Brussels, Au¬ gust 1991) turned out to be even more diffi¬ cult for Karpov than his match with Yusupov, and it took a very similar course. Possibly he was again affected by the unaccustomed six- hour time control, but more probably it was general psychological tiredness (which later was to cause his downfall in the semi-final with Short). At any event, the parade of mu¬ tual mistakes and omissions in the Brussels match broke all conceivable records. They played to the best of eight games. As in the match with Sokolov four years earlier, the two players contested only two openings — the Caro-Kann Defence and the Meran Varia¬ tion, prepared by Anand specially for this match. In the 1st game Vishy chose a rare variation against the Caro-Kann (1 e4 c6 2 d3) and was outplayed in quiet manoeuvring. But towards the end of the sixth hour of play, in the time scramble before the second control, Karpov missed a win. 59...JLf5? (the simple 59...<i?f5 and ...<4>e4 would have won) 60 JLxb6! Bxb6 61 Sxe2 2d6 62 St?c3! 2d3+ 63 *c4 Ba3 64 st?c5 2xa4 65 b6 2b4 66 5a2 Sbl 67 Bxa5 with a draw on the 76th move. After this the play of both contestants be¬ came feverish. In the 2nd game, where for the first time he encountered Anand’s ‘Meran’, the ex-champion played uncertainly in the middle- game and only saved himself literally by a miracle. 42.. .b4?! (42...1rf5 43 ±e5 g5! was simpler- Anand) 43 f3! (the only chance) 43...b3? Winning a pawn, but allowing White to set up a fortress. According to Anand, 43...c3 44 bxc3 b3 45 Jta3 Jtxfi was better, but 43.. .®b7! was even stronger, with the decisive threat of ...c4-c3. 423 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 44 ±b4 ±xf3 45 #f4 Wbl 46 Ac3 with a draw on the 73rd move. In the 3rd game, Anand managed to seize the initiative after an unpretentiously played opening and achieve a completely won posi¬ tion. But in his opponent’s time-trouble he missed a quick win on the 38th move, and then he altogether allowed him to slip out. 45 Hf8?? The game would have concluded instantly after 45 Hfd8! Bxf4 46 g4! with the decisive threat of Hh4 mate. 45.. .*b7 46 #d8 (46 2g8(f6) Wc4 47 ‘ihS 48 Sxg6 no longer wins in view of 48.. .#xf4+ 49 Ig3 h6!

Game No.95, note to White’s 10th move) and by accurate play he converted it into a win. It appeared that everything was settled — but that wasn’t the case! In the 5th game, against the Caro-Kann Defence, Anand chose the 3 e5 variation, its unhurried version with and Ae2, which was then coming into fashion. And he completely outplayed his formidable opponent! 61 exf6+? (the transition into a knight end¬ ing would have won easily — 61 flxc7+ ^xc7 62 <£>h7 etc.) 61...*xf6 62 Ib8 £id6 63 *f4 Scl The sealed move. The adjourned position looks hopeless for Black, but during the re¬ sumption Anand blundered on the 74th move, and 20 moves later a draw was agreed. In the 6th game, as in the 2nd, Karpov again handled a ‘Meran’ middlegame badly. Anand gained a decisive advantage and after the adjournment he won on the 71st move. But that same day, a little earlier, Vishy missed a win in the adjourned 5th game... If he had won it, the situation would have been a mirror reflection of Baguio, where Karpov achieved something similar (on the resumption of the 13th and 14th games). What in fact resulted was a ‘mirror’ of the 1989 match, where by contrast Yusupov, although without any ad¬ journments, won the 5th game and missed a win in the 6th. At any event, the match score became 424 Anatoly the Twelfth equal. In the 7th game, again in a quiet Caro- Kann, Anand conducted the middlegame very subdy, obtained a better ending and... missed yet another chance to take the lead. 41 Hc8?

And again, as in the match with Yusupov, at the decisive mo¬ ment the ex-champion employed a compara¬ tively fresh idea and achieved the turning point in this extremely difficult encounter. Game 95 A.Karpov-V.Anand Candidates Match, Brussels 1991, 8th game _Semi-Slav Defence D46_ 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 £>f3 ®f6 4 ®c3 e6 5 e3 ®bd7 6 ®c2 Since the Meran’ was a new opening for Anand, Karpov deliberately avoided the most heavily-analysed line with 6 Jtd3 {Game Nos. 80; 103 and 105) throughout the match; besides, he had already successfully employed 6 Wc2 against Van der Wiel (Tilburg 1988). 6...jLd6 7 Jte2 Closer to the end of the century Karpov would develop his bishop at d3 — the generally recognised way of fighting for the initiative. 7...0-0 8 0-0 dxc4 With the bishop on e2, relieving the tension in the centre can be delayed. 8...b6 is sounder, exploiting the fact that after 9 e4 the double exchange on e4 does not lose a pawn, as in the event of 7 jtd3. In the game Karpov- Kaidanov (Tilburg 1993) 9...^ixe4 10 4hte4 dxe4 11 WxeA kbl 12 Ad3 g6 13 Ah6 Se8 14 Sadi f5 15 We3 c5 led to a roughly equal game. 9 ±xc4 ®e7 A tabiya of the even-numbered games of the match. It was only in the 2nd game that Anand played 9...a6 followed by 10 Sdl We7l? 11 h3 b5 12 Ad3 c5 with equality, and in the future it was this move that would be judged the most flexible, enabling Black to retain various options involving both ...b7-b5 (and then ...c6-c5), and also ...e6-e5. 10 a3 Before this Karpov played 10 h3 — and in ' the 4th game he achieved success after 10...a6 11 e4! e5 12 Sdl! b5 13 Afl c5 14 d5 c4!? 15 a4 Sb8 16 axb5 axb5 17 Sa5! b4 18 £la4 Wd8 19 Sa7 b3!? 20 We2 £lc5 21 £kc5 Axc5 22 Sal! c3! 23 ^xe5! c2 24 Sd3 #e8?

The modem interpretation of this position is as follows: White has made some useful pawn moves and he now intends to deploy his pieces suitably (JLa2, then per¬ haps JLd2). The struggle revolves around the pawn tension in the centre, the capture on d4 being unfavourable for Black, since it opens the diagonal for the bishop at cl and also the e-file for an attack on his queen. Therefore he must also wait, endeavouring to make useful moves, but their choice is restricted. The re¬ treat of the bishop from d6 suggests itself, to reduce the effect of the potential threat ^h4, which becomes pressing if ...h7-h6 is played — but Black needs this move, to impart greater strength to the ...e5-e4 advance (11...e4 12 £>g5). It is around such nuances that the opening batde is fought. 11 ...jtc7 At one time the rather artificial 11_fi-b8 was deemed more subtle. The temporary shutting in of the rook was considered less important than the bishop at c7 being undefended in some variations. In several games, including some involving Karpov, the set-up ll...Jtb8 12 Aa2 h6 13 £\h4 Hd8 14 <$}f5 ®e8 showed itself to be good. But then it transpired that the natural 1 1..

Black could not employ the other set-up 13...Sd8 14 <$}f5 WeS on account of 15 4^b5! It was this nuance that forced attention to be drawn to ll...Ab8. 14 £if5 #f8 15 (15 d5 has also been tried, but without particular success) 15.. .±b8 16 JLd2! With the threat — no more and no less — of trapping the queen. 16.. .a5 As has already been mentioned, 16...exd4 17 exd4 is unfavourable for Black. But now energetic action is demanded of White — all his pieces are hanging, and if he does not exploit the dominating position of the knight at £5, Black will ‘unravel himself and will be excel¬ lently placed. 17 dxe5 ±xe5?! An error, although the influence of this move on the outcome of the game was exag¬ gerated. Black had two sensible alternatives: 17.. .<5ixe5 18 ^bd4 c5 or even 17...fixe5 18 4k3 ^c5, driving away the knight from f5 and after 19 ^g3 fle8 20 f4 Jta7 obtaining a com¬ plicated position with chances for both sides. 426 Anatoly the Twelfth 18 f4! White increases his attacking potential on the kingside. Black cannot be satisfied with 18.. .cxb5? 19 fxe5 Sxe5 (19...^xe5 20 <5lxh6+) 20 Jlc3 and he is forced to retreat his bishop. Thus White has solved the problem of maintaining his knight at £5. 18.. .1.b8 19^c3 ld8?! The knight at f5 is too dangerous, and in the first instance Black should have begun a fight against it — 19...^)c5!? It is true that he has to reckon with 20 £}xh6+ gxh6 21 ®g6+ »g7 22 Axf7+ <^f8 23 Axe8 <5)xe8, but the evaluation of this position is not so obvious. In the endgame - 24 Wxg7+ <4>xg7 — Black has nothing to fear (if 25 e4, then 25...<5)d6 is strong). After 24 Wh5 Aa7 it is certainly bet¬ ter to be playing White, but there is a tense struggle in prospect, in which Black has his counter-chances. In the event of the preparatory 19,..^h8 White has time to transform his weak e3-pawn into a significant attacking piece. The tactical rejoinder 20 e4 4k5 21 e5 £)fe4 22 ^xh6 gxh6 23 Q\xe4 JtfS provokes a queen sacri¬ fice: 24 WxcSl?

Anand’s move pursues the same aim: it prepares ...<5)c5, while avoiding ^bdi6+. But Karpov finds a drawback to the position of the black rook at d8. 20 Ael! (if 20...^c5, then 21 Jlh4 is very strong) 20..Ah7 21 Ah4 ^df6 22 ladl White has clearly made progress: he has re¬ tained his mobile pawn pair and the powerful bishop at a2 and knight at f5, his other bishop has moved from cl to an active position at h4, while Black’s pieces are huddled on the 8th rank and instead of going to c5 his knight has ended up at h7. And in particular — 23 £)xh6+ is threatened. 22.. .Hxd1 Radical measures with 22... Axf5 23 WxfS Aa7 24 Af2 Wc5? would have given White a probably won endgame after 25 Wxc5 Axc5 26 e4 Axf2+ 27 &xf2 (his bishop is very strong!).

An amazing coincidence, wouldn’t you agree? But only at first sight In fact Karpov again displayed his rare fighting qualities in critical situations, showing that he had not forgotten how to win £to order’. A month later the ex-world champion per¬ formed splendidly in the first — and alas, as it turned out, the last — stage of the second World Cup (Reykjavik, autumn 1991). Only a missed win during the resumption of his last- round game with Chandler (a draw on the 119th move!) denied him clear first place: 1-2. Ivanchuk and Karpov — IOV2 out of 15. But soon Vishy also demonstrated his potential, winning a kind of TJSSR super-championship’ (Reggio Emilia, 1991/92): 1. Anand — 6 out of 9; 2-3. Gelfand and Kasparov — 5Vi; 4. Kar¬ pov — 5; 5-7. Ivanchuk, Khalifman and Po- lugayevsky — 4%, etc. After his match with Anand the £anti- Meran’ variation with 6 Wc2 became firmly established in Karpov’s repertoire and brought him several striking wins, gained at a time when the leading grandmasters were only just groping for the correct ways out of this insidi¬ ous labyrinth. Very characteristic is this game with the 20-year-old Alexei Shirov — another rising star from the end of the 20th century. Game 96 A.Karpov-A.Shirov Biel 1992,13th round _Semi-Slav Defence D46_ 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ^c3 &f6 4 e3 e6 5 £tf3 £>bd7 6 Wc2 Ad6 7 ±e2 0-0 8 0-0 dxc4 9 ±xc4 b5 Seemingly more energetic than 9,.Mel (Game No. 95), and a typical ‘Meran’ continua¬ tion. The fact that it was chosen by Shirov is not surprising. At that time the theory of this variation was not developed at all. 10 Jle2 He8 Or 10...1ic7 11 J,d2 fie8 12 flacl with some advantage to White (Karpov-Van der Wiel, Tilburg 1988). 10.. Jtb7 is more natural, but in those years the prevailing opinion was that White’s plans should involve e3-e4, and then after ...e6-e5 the black rook will prove well placed (as had already occurred in one of Shirov’s games). 11 fidl #c7 Since White has not played the opening very actively. Black can permit himself certain liberties, by employing a hybrid of different variations. Even so, experience has shown that in such a set-up the typical manoeuvre ^c3-e4 enables White to gain the initiative. Inciden¬ tally, in the variation 9...a6 10 Sdl Wcl the move 11 ^e4! was first tried in practice by grandmaster Epishin, one of Karpov’s long¬ standing assistants. 12 b3 e5 13 h3 (defending against 13...e4) 13.. .±b7 Against Tukmakov (Biel Open 1992) Sha- balov successfully upheld Black’s position af¬ ter 13...a6 14 ±b2 exd4 15 <£>xd4 ±bl 16 &f5 ±f8 17 £M5 £>xd5 18 Sxd5 Se6.

It is hard to call such a natural move a mis¬ take. The immediate 16...b4?! 17 ^hbl c5 18 £}bd2 would have given White an enduring positional advantage, thanks to his control of the c4-square and the possibility of an attack on the c5-pawn. The rook move was made in the hope of playing ...b5-b4 at a more conven¬ ient moment, but... Meanwhile Shirov misses a genuinely con¬ venient moment: after 16...4^xf3+! 17 J§Lxf3 jLh24- 18 <4hl Jle5 it would have been no longer possible to prevent the freeing advance ...c6-c5. 17 <£>g5!

Shirov prepares exchanges on the d- file, but Karpov sets him a new problem. 20 £ig3! How to counter the threat of 4^f5 followed by f2-f4? 20...g6 suggests itself, but it is not easy to decide on such a weakening of the long dark-squared diagonal with the bishop not at f8, but at b4. And indeed, after 21 £ie4 defending is no simple matter. If 21...f5, then 22 f4 flxdl+ 23 ttxdl ^3g4 24 hxg4 Hfxe4 25 #xe4 £xe4 26 Id7 fie7 27 fid8+ 4>f7 28 Hh8 sl?e6 29 g5! is strong, while after 25...flxe4 26 ±e5! Ixe3 27 Id8+ 4>f7 28 <4*1 the bishop at b7 cannot be saved. 20...f6 Shirov thought that this was the lesser evil, but now Karpov immediately exploits the weakening of the light squares. 21 Jbce5! An unexpected exchange, which is justified by concrete calculation. After 21...fxe5 (best) 22 Jtd3 g6 23 Jte4 Black would have faced a cheerless defence, which clearly did not appeal to Shirov. 21 ...HfxeB?! 22 Jtd3 (how to defend the h7-pawn?) 22...h6?! You need to have great courage to decide on 22...g6, allowing 23 Jtxg6 hxg6 24 ®xg6+ 4>h8 (24...4>f8 25 £if5 and wins) 25 #h6+ <4g8 26 <£3h5 f5 27 ^3f6+ 4*7 28 £ke8 Hxe8. Here White has many tempting continuations, for example: 29 Wh7+ Wgl 30 Sd7+ fie7 31 J Hfxf5+ ®f6 with a choice between retaining the queens, and an endgame where the four connected passed pawns should, of course, ensure a win, but the two black bishops plus the potential passed pawn on the c-file should 429 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors also not be underestimated. At the board it is always difficult to solve such problems: the drawbacks to each of the moves are fairly obvious. Shirov, who in this game did not make a single bad move (but a whole series of second-rate ones) preferred not to disrupt the material balance, hoping to sur¬ vive the opponent’s attack on the light squares. But his hopes were not realised: Karpov con¬ cludes the game quickly and impressively. 23 ±g6 2f8 24 fcfB c5 The other defensive line — 24...^cS 25 Hfe4 Jtc8 — can also be breached: 26 fidcl JLxf5 27 JLxf5 Jtc3 28 axb5!

After 32...Ial+ 33 4>h2 Wb8+ 34 f4 White gives mate. In 1992 Karpov won three tournaments — in Madrid, Biel and Baden-Baden. However, on the whole this year proved to be one of the most tragic in his career: in the spring in Linares he unexpected lost his semi-final Can¬ didates match to Nigel Short: 4-6 (in the other semi-final Yusupov went down by the same score to Timman). This sensational event provoked a genuine furore in the chess world. The match reviews in the leading chess maga2ines were littered with garish headlines: "The end of an era’ (New in Chess), "Has the time connection been bro¬ ken?’ (Chess Herald), "End of an era as West¬ erners oust Russians in World Championship Candidates’ (British Chess Magazine), "Downfall of the gods in Linares’ (Schah-Maga^n 64), "An historic moment — Karpov is knocked out’ (Jaque), ‘Short marks the end of an era’ (Rrnsta Intemacional de AJedre^) etc. Hans Ree wrote in New in Chess'. "The matches were won by the players with the best time-planning. It was terrible to have to watch Karpov in particular in the appalling time- trouble he was in in nearly every game. And that was not all. His iron nerve seemed to have deserted him. I’ve seen him in time- trouble before but he always kept his cool. Now he was wriggling with tension, his face wracked with emotion. His psychologist, Za- gainov, was in the front row. The man Who should have been exuding tranquillity was bit¬ ing his nails and wringing his hands, as an¬ guished as his pupil.’ Soon a book by Rudolf Zagainov, devoted to this match, was pub¬ lished in Moscow with the symbolic tide Po- raybenie (Defeat). Also interesting were the observations of Valery Murakhveri, a columnist of the maga¬ zine Chess Herald. 430 Anatoly the Twelfth ‘Karpov possesses a unique match experi¬ ence. The magazine Schah-Magcufn 64 counted up that over 18 years he has played 254 games in matches, of which 144 have been against Kasparov. With his subtle knowledge of the psychology and philosophy of matchplay, it appeared that Karpov should not have experi¬ enced any difficulties in connection with Short's style and manner of play. It should have been expected that Karpov’s superiority in strategically defined positions and the end¬ game would become the decisive factor in the match, since the opponent would hardly be able to neutralise it, even by imposing a purely tactical battle. ‘However, the 14-year age difference proved in this match to be a disadvantage to Karpov. Age manifests itself primarily in an ability to maintain a consistently high competi¬ tive standard. Against a background of cus¬ tomary successes, increasingly often there are periods of decline, poor form, and elementary ill-health. With some players this occurs ear¬ lier, with others later, but a borderline at the age of 40 can be considered more or less normal. The situation around Karpov has also changed: in his team, which used to be so numerous and highly-qualified, for various reasons changes and reductions have oc¬ curred. This process, to all appearances, has not been a painless one for Karpov: in the press he expressed his grievances to a whole series of grandmasters for not helping him, and helping his opponents. People who sup¬ ported or served him faithfully have either departed or lost influence, which also could not fail to affect his fighting spirit’ My own comment on what had happened was as follows: ‘For chess it is beneficial that a player from the West should contend for the highest tide. This will significantly raise inter¬ est in chess in the media and the general pub¬ lic... I do not give preference to either of the finalists — Timman or Short, but for chess it would be better if Short were to win. For the public it is more interesting when the chal¬ lenger is younger than the champion.’ At the time many thought that this was in¬ deed the end of the Karpov era. No one could even suspect how chess history would change in 1993... Against the Queen's Indian The time has come to divert our attention for a short time from the competitive feats of the 12th world champion and talk about his con¬ tribution to the theory of the closed games — or more precisely, to his interpretation of those quiet strategic set-ups which corre¬ sponded most fully with his style. As I have already mentioned, Karpov felt very confident in the Queen’s Indian Defence — with both colours. It is not surprising that many wins by him with White have become classic games for this opening. In this respect 1993 was a very bountiful year. At the end of February, at the start of the super-tournament in Linares, that annual ‘chess Wimbledon’, Karpov was twice suc¬ cessful in the Queen’s Indian with 4 g3 — against both 4.. Jtb7 and 4... jta6.

However, after 9...d6 10 d5 ^xd2 11 ®xd2 in the game Karpov-Salov (Reykjavik 1991) White won in a protracted manoeuvring struggle, by exploiting his spatial advantage: 12 e4 ^hdl 13 *hd4 ±xd4 14 ®xd4 e5 15 »d2 a5 16 f4 £>c5 17 f5 f6 18 ±B etc. 431 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors And although during the course of the game Salov had chances of sharpening the situation, he apparendy did not like the very character of the play. 10 d5 exd5 11 cxd5 <£>xd2 12 <£>xd2 d6 13 £>de4!

However, Black is not yet obliged to go in for such extreme measures — for example, the simple 16...h6 is possible. But the most interesting move is 16...4^f6. After 17 4^f2 the reply 17...h6 18 h4 g5P! is excessively risky on account of 19 hxg5 hxg5 20 e3, and the weakening of the kingside may prove critical. It is safer to return — 17...4kl7, in order after 18 g5 to play the timely 18...f6, and if 18 Wc2 to mechanically prevent the advance of the white pawns — 18...h6. 17g5H8 18 4>h1 b5 It is probable that Salov decided on this with a heavy heart, but there is no other way of creating counterplay. 19 axb5 axb5 20 £>xb5 #b6 21 £>bc3 Black’s activity on the queenside is aimed merely at diverting White’s attention from the kingside. However, even if should succeed in winning the b2-pawn, this will only signify the restoring of material equality, and not at all the creation of real counterplay. 21.. .#b4 Black prevents an increase in the attacking potential after Hf3-h3, but now the white queen heads there, and things become even more difficult for him. 22 #d3 £b6 23 #g3! <&>h8 24 Icdl White has an extra pawn, well placed pieces and the prospect of a direct attack on the king, whereas the opponent’s counterplay is illusory — all the indications are that Black has com¬ pletely lost the battle. 24.. .£>c4 432 Anatoly the Twelfth It was possible to eliminate the b2-pawn and even create the semblance of a counterat¬ tack — 24...^3a4 25 £5 4^xb2 26 fibl Ha3, but after 27 flf4 c4 28 Sh4 White would have begun a decisive assault: 28...fixe4 29 Sxe4 flxc3 30 Ue8 4^8 31 #h4, and there is no defence against 32 g6. It is also not possible to restrain the advance of the pawns: 24... Jtc8 25 f5 fie5 26 g6! Jtxf5 27 ^g5! Jtxg6 28 4^xf7+ jLxf7 29 Hxf7 followed by playing the bishop from g2 to e6. 25 b3! £ib6 The knight is forced to return empty- handed. In the event of 25...®xb3 26 Hbl 4^b2 White has a pleasant choice between continuing the attack (27 £5) and winning ma¬ terial — 27 flfdl etc. 26 g6! The most energetic — ‘Sicilian style’ — de¬ velopment of the attack. White would also have won after 26 £5 Sa3 27 g6 f6 28 gxh7 Bxb3? 29 H?g6, and although 28...4tkl7 en¬ ables Black to resist somehow, after 29 4ixd6 he is unable to hold out. White’s position is so strong that one can observe a rare instance in the practice of the great pragmatist Karpov: he rejects gain of material in favour of a direct attack! 26.. .fxg6 27 f5 gxf5 28 fixf5 £id7 29 Hdfl 29 ^xd6 Jtxd6 30 ttxd6 4^f8 (or 30.. .#xc3 31 #xd7 ±a6 32 Sdfl) 31 %3 was also possible, but Karpov no longer wants to deviate from his general plan of concentrat¬ ing pieces in the vicinity of the black king. 29...£ie5 30 25f4 ifb6 (it is also bad to play 30...^g6 31 flg4 — 'with the threat of Sxg6 - 31...£ie5 32 Hh4) 31 £ig5 £ig6 This allows an elegant conclusion. But oth¬ erwise the white bishop joins the attack with decisive effect: 31..Jte7 32 4^f7+ 4^xf7 33 flxf7 J,f8 34 ±e4!, or 31...g6 32 flh4 h5 33 £lf7+ 4>g7 34 Jte4. 32 4tf7+ *g8 33 Wxg6! 1-0 In view of 33...hxg6 34 fih4. In the 2nd round the ex-champion lost to Timman, but this did nothing to cool his fighting spirit. Game 98 A. Karpov - A.

The earlier continuation — 13...b5 14 Sel dxc4 15 bxc4, which was tested in the aforementioned matches, is still topical in the 21st century (I should mention the game Bologan-Kramnik, Dortmund 2004). 14 exd5 exd5 15 dxc5 dxc4 16 c6 cxb3 17 Bel ±bb A sound enough reply, but today 17...b2 18 jtxb2 £ic5 is considered best (a recent exam¬ ple: Topalov-Anand, FIDE World Champion¬ ship, San Luis 2005). 18 axb3! At one time they used to play 18 *5ixb3 and it was thought that Black had no problems in equalising. A model example was provided by the attractive drawn game Yusupov-Sax (Rot¬ terdam 1989): 18...Jtxc6 19 Jtxg7 <&>xg7 20 £k!4 ±xg2 21 &B+ 4>h8 22 Bxe7 ±h3 23 1tfd4+ £k5 24 Wxe5+ f6 25 We2 JtxfS 26 Idl ±g4. 18.. .1x6 19 lxc6 Bxc6 20 Bxa7!

Jtxc3 22 Bxd7 ®a8 Black has usually maintained the balance. 21.. .£ic5 It is interesting that in the 16th game of his match with Kamsky (Elista 1996), when the outcome was already practically decided, Kar¬ pov played this variation as Black and replied with 21...itxc3 here. But after 22 Uxd7 Wf6 23 fle4 he overlooked an elementary tactical stroke - 23...WG? 24 flf4 We6 25 Hdxf7l, based on the lack of an escape square for the black king. If he had concerned himself with this by playing 23...h6, equality would still have been achievable. 22 Wxd8 Hxd8 22.. . Axd8 would have allowed White to re¬ tain very strong pressure in the endgame by 23 J*b4 Jlc7 24 fidl. 23 jtxf6 Bxf6? After the match with Kamsky, in the game Van Wely-Karpov (Cap d’Agde rapidplay 1996) 23...gxf6! was played, and 24 £ie3 ^xb3 25 £)f5 Scl led in the end to a draw. In the event of 24 fiee7 ^xb3 25 4ie3 flf8 26 £if5 Black has the strong move 26...h5!, freeing his king and neutralising White’s threat of 27 4ih6+ 4?g7 28 ^xf7 &g6, when he has noth¬ ing to fear. 24 b4! £ie6?! It turns out that the knight has no good square. The lesser evil was to go into a rook ending a pawn down: 24...b5 (24...^1a4, with the same aim, does not work, since instead of 25 Bxa4 Wliite has the strong 25 fid7! Hf8 26 Be5 with a great advantage) 25 bxc5 bxc4 26 fia4 Hc6 27 flxc4 — the presence of all four rooks leaves Black hopes of saving the game. 25 £ixb6 £g5 26 Id7! £>f3+ 27 4?f1 Bb8 28 Sedl Skilfully combining attacking operations with his small army and the threat of transpos¬ ing into a technically won endgame, Karpov accurately converts his advantage. 28...<4^8 29 £d5 He6 30 ®c7 Hh6 31 h4 g5 32 hxg5 ®xg5 After 32...Shl+ 33 <4)g2 flxdl 34 fixdl <53xg5 35 fld5 4ie6 36 lib 5 Black has a choice between several lost endings. 33 Bld5! ^e4 34 Id8+ Bxd8 35 Bxd8+ 4>g7 (the rook ending after 35...'4^7 36 Be8+ 4)d7 37 Ixe4 <4>xc7 38 Sf4 is completely hopeless) 36 £ie8+ <4g6 37 4?g2 f6 38 Id7 Ih5 39 Bg7+ <4h6 40 Be7 f5 41 Se6+ 4>g5 1-0 And in view of the obvious 42 f4+ <4)g4 43 JSxe4 Black resigned. I should remind you that by this time Short had won the final Candidates match against Timman (61/2-41/2) and had suggested to me 435 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors that with one sweep we should sever the mass of problems that had accumulated in the ne¬ gotiations with Campomanes: to contest the world championship outside of the framework of FIDE! Deciding that this was a convenient moment finally to place chess on a profes¬ sional basis, I agreed. And on 26th February, at the height of the battles in Linares, Short and I made an unexpected statement, which had far-reaching consequences for the chess wodd: about the fact that ‘Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short have agreed to play their match outside the jurisdiction of FIDE. The match will be played under the auspices of a new body, The Professional Chess Associa¬ tion... which is intended to represent chess professionals worldwide and work for the good of the game/ But the super-tournament continued to run its course. After eight rounds Anand was lead¬ ing, half a point ahead of Karpov and me. But in the 9th and 10th rounds I managed to win with White against Anand and with Black against Karpov (the Samisch Variation in the King's Indian Defence — this was our 162nd encounter!), which decided the outcome of the event as a whole: 1. Kasparov — 10 out of 13; 2-3. Anand and Karpov — 8V2; 4. Shirov — 8; 5. Kramnik - 7Vi; 6-7. Ivanchuk and Salov — 6V2; 8. Beliavsky — 6, etc. Within a week, on 23rd March, without fur¬ ther ado the FIDE management deprived Short and I of the rights of champion and challenger — and at the same time offered the right to play a ‘match for the world champion¬ ship' to the two reserve candidates, the losers in the qualifying cycle, Timman and Karpov! This sudden chance to regain the crown, even if only the FIDE version of it, literally reanimated and transformed the ex-champion. In April and July Karpov won tournaments in Dos Hermanas and Dortmund, and in the autumn, while I was beating Short, he did not allow any chances to Timman, who main¬ tained an equal score only for the first five games... After gaining the title of FIDE world champion, in November he won his seventh(l) tournament in Tilburg, held on the then fash¬ ionable knock-out system. In mini-matches he overcame, one after another, Romani shin, Vyzhmanavin, Kaidanov (both on a tie-break), Yusupov, Beliavsky and, again on a tie-break, Ivanchuk. Here the Queen's Indian theme was con¬ tinued by the following game, in which Kar¬ pov played the early middlegame in very inter¬ esting fashion. Game 99 A. Karpov-A.Yusupov Tilburg 1993, 5th round 1 d4 £>f6 2 c4 e6 3 £>f3 b6 4 g3 ±b7 5 Jtg2 kel 6 ^c3 ^e4 7 ±62 ±f$ 8 ®c2!? (8 0-0 - Game No.97) 8...£>xd2 9 ®xd2 A typical position: Black has the two bish¬ ops, while White dominates the centre and controls more space. 9...d6 10 d5 0-0 11 £>d4! Inviting the capture on d4 — this leads to a position similar to the aforementioned Kar- pov-Salov game (Reykjavik 1991 — cf. Game No.97, note to Black’s 9th move). Yusupov prefers to retain his bishop. 11 ...e5 12®c6 #d7 13®xb8 2fxb8 It would appear that Black has no reason 436 Anatoly the Twelfth for complaint In the event of 14 0-0 he can develop his bishop at g7 and prepare ...f7-f5, and countering this with £2-f4 will lead to the activation of the dark-squared bishop, which has no opponent 14 h4! Unexpected and strong. White not only seizes space on the kingside (after ...g7-g6 the attack h4-h5 is possible), but primarily he pre¬ pares to bring out his bishop to h3. Its role there is very important, and its exchange after .. JLb7-c8 is advantageous to White, since the weakening of the opponent’s light squares will be more keenly felt. 14.. .a5?! A routine move for positions of this type, where White usually prepares a pawn offen¬ sive on the queenside. Yusupov either did not anticipate what happened next, or else he overestimated the solidity of his defences. 14...a6 would have enabled Black to hope for counterplay. Of course. White has not yet castled long and after 15 Jth3 ®e8 16 ^e4 he could have castled on the kingside. But with this development of events Black would have retained more possibilities than in the game. 15 a4! Karpov stabilises the situation on the queenside, in order to begin aggressive action on the kingside. 15.. .1f8 16 e4 h5 (if 16...g6, then 17 h5 is unpleasant) 17 0-0-0! White reveals his cards. His king is com¬ pletely safe: due to the nature of the pawn structure on the queenside. Black cannot hope to make any undermining pawn moves or pawn storms. 17.. .g6 18 !,h3 We7 19 <4>c2 Manoeuvring begins, in a situation where White has more space and possibilities of strengthening his position. 19.. .6g7?! A consistent defensive course. If 19..Jtg7,\ then 20 g4 hxg4 21 ±xg4 f5 22 ±B looks strong, but after the queen sacrifice 20...1Hrxh4! 21 gxh5 Wxh5 22 1x8 #xdl+ 23 Wxdl ±xcS (24 4}b5 ±d7) the question arises: can White win here? 20 f3 lh8 21 Bh2 i.a6 22 £ib5! 2af8 White is not afraid of the exchange 22... Jtxb5 23 cxb5!, leaving opposite-coloured bishops on the board. Of course, Black will defend his c7-pawn with his bishop from d8, but sooner or later White will advantageously advance f3-f4. However, Karpov sets about preparing this breakthrough even without the exchange on b5. 23 *b1 Wd8 24 #d3 ±e7 25 Ie2 ±c8?\ Yusupov became tired of waiting and de¬ cided nevertheless to exchange bishops, but possibly he should not have done this. Now White has a very easy game, and his knight has gained the opportunity to break through to c6. 26 ±xc8 #xc8 27 Igl ±68 This passivity is forced: 27...f5? 28 f4 would 437 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors have quickly led to insoluble problems. 28 £>a7 Wh3 29 #c2 He8 30 £ic6 ±f6 31 2f2 *d7 32 We2 2hf8 33 2h2 Preparing a favourable moment for g3-g4 or f3-f4. Karpov maintains the tension, realis¬ ing that it is not easy for Black to guess his opponent’s intentions. And indeed, fearing both of these breakthroughs, Yusupov was unable to find a way out of his difficult posi¬ tion. 33...2h8 34 Wf2 2ef8 35 Ifl <4>g8?! Black could have put up a more tenacious resistance, if he had forestalled the advance of the f-pawn: 35...Be8 36 g4 4>g8 37 %3 ±g7. 36 f4! Wg4 37 Wf3! Ie8 (37...trx£3 38 Bxf3 Se8 39 Shf2 Sh7 40 f5 is worse for Black) 38 1Bfxg4 hxg4 39 f5 g5?! This makes it easier for White. 39...'4>g7, maintaining the pawn tension, was more tena¬ cious, although I think that White would have gradually decided matters by breaking through on the queenside: &c2, b2-b4, and if ...axb4 — ^PbSxbl etc. 40 h5 2a8 41 4>c2 4?g7 42 <&>c3 2a6 43 2a 1 2ha8 44 b4 cf8 A desperate exchange sacrifice. In the event of 44...axb4+ 45 4?xb4 (4>h6 the most elegant way to win was pointed out by Ftacnik: 46 <A>b5 ±g7 47 f6 Jth8 48 flf2 *h7 49 h6 <i>g6 50 h7!, and all that is left is a series of ‘spite’ checks 50...Sa5+ 51 £ixa5 Bxa5+ 52 4?c6 2c5+, which culminates in mate: 53 4?d7 Bxc4 54 a5 bxa5 55 Bxa5 Bxe4 56 fla8 sl?xh7 57 ^e7 etc. 45 b5 White could also have won by 45 bxa5 bxa5 46 Sbl, but Karpov righdy decided that a ‘fortress’ would not be achieved. 45.. .26a7 46 h6 J.h8 It is interesting that after 46../i?g8 47 h7+ ^h8 48 Bahl Sb7 49 Bh6 ±g7 it is White who sacrifices the exchange — 50 £6! Jtxh6 51 Bxh6, and Black is absolutely helpless: 51.. .2e8 52 £ie7 (planning £if5-e3xg4, which will open a way for the invasion of the king) 52.. .5xe7 53 fxe7 2b8 54 c5! bxc5 55 b6! 47 f6! (not essential, but effective) 47...JLxf6 48 2f1 AhS 49 £xa7 2xa7 50 2h5 *e7 51 2xg5 2a8 52 h7 f6 53 2g8 2f8 54 c5 dxc5 55 *c4 <4>f7 56 d6 cxd6 57 2xf8+ 4>xf8 58 4>d5 1-0 The successful year 1993 saw Karpov begin a new and final surge, enabling him to achieve several more outstanding results in events of world standard. Suffocation of the Grunfeld The solid set-up with g2-g3 became the 12th world champion’s favourite weapon against the Grunfeld and the King’s Indian Defences. Karpov was probably attracted by its univer¬ sality and the fact that in the resulting posi¬ tions Black cannot immediately display activ¬ ity. He was especially successfully in symmet¬ rical positions, when his opponent’s tried to 438 Anatoly the Twelfth neutralise Whitens initiative with the help of the c6- and d5-pawn wedge. I should remind you that Bronstein resorted to this in the 23rd game of his match with Botvinnik, and al¬ though he equalised fairly easily, in the end the world champion managed to turn a level end¬ game in his favour (Volume 2, Game No. 66). For a long time these positions were con¬ sidered too tedious. The entire wisdom re¬ duced to the fact that, if Black could manage to play ,..^f6~e4, the chances would suppos¬ edly be equal. Say, after 1 d4 <Sif6 2 c4 g6 3 g3 Jtg7 4 Jtg2 c6 5 ^f3 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 0-0 0-0 8 4tic3 he should play 8...£ie4! Corre¬ spondingly, White does better to play 8 ^e5! immediately, retaining a slight initiative, al¬ though this would not seem to promise him anything serious. Nevertheless, for example, Petrosian against Korchnoi in the 4th game of their match in Odessa (1974) gained an advan¬ tage in this way and converted it into a win. The main defence was considered to be 8...e6 9 0-0 £ifd7, evicting the knight from e5. This is also what I played — twice in the 1986 return match (3rd and 13th games) and twice in the 1987 match (1st and 3rd games), each time gaining a draw (more details about this in Volume 7). But later Karpov successfully demonstrated that these symmetrical set-ups are by no means so harmless for Black, as at first sight I will give two of his classic games against leading young grandmasters, where he demonstrated an unusually subtie understand¬ ing of these Sterile’ positions. The first is from a super-tournament, dedi¬ cated to the 100th anniversary of Alekhine’s birth (Moscow, autumn 1992). Here Karpov scored only 3Vi out of 7, but for his game with Gata Kamsky the jury — consisting of Botvinnik, Lilienthal and Najdorf! - awarded him the prize ‘for a win in Alekhine’s style’. True, one of the commentators on the game, grandmaster Mikhail Krasenkow, ob¬ jected: To me this decision is questionable. Indeed, in the games of the first Russian world champion there are several examples of the play transferring from the queenside to the kingside. But here it was the other way round — the struggle switched from the kingside to the queenside. And this is Karpov’s style!’ Game 100 A. Karpov-G.

Timman’s play can probably be improved, but after ll...^dxe5 Black apparently has no clear way to equalise. Other ways had to be sought... 11.. .41b6?! Kamsky follows the 1 st game of the Seville match (1987). The ease with which I equalised apparently put Gata in an optimistic frame of mind. But he had not delved into the subtle¬ ties of the position. In fact, the development 439 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors plan carried out by Black is not sufficient for equality and it is better to drive away the knight immediately by 1 l...f6 (Game No. 101). 12±f2 i.d7 After 12...f6 Black now has to reckon with 13 £lxc6 bxc6 14 e4! It was because of the positional threat e2-e4 that in the 3rd game of the Seville match I preferred 12...^e7. 13 e4! £ie7 14 £ixd7 #xd7 15 e5 White has made progress: he has advanced his backward pawn to e5 and gained space. For the moment the position is closed and the strength of the two bishops is not felt But White has the prospect of opening the game by the advance of his kingside pawns. Black, meanwhile, is hoping for counterplay on the queenside: to prevent the leap of the knight to c4. White will have to play b2-b3, and then Black can create pressure on the c-file. He is also hoping that White’s activity will not lead to a rapid result, i.e. that the pawn storm (g3- g4, f4-£5) will not prove deadly. 15...2ac8 I played 15...Hfc8 (this hardly changes any¬ thing, since all the same Black needs to double rooks on the c-file) 16 flcl Jlf8. Here Karpov played rather cautiously — 17 Jtf3, and the chances became equal: 17...fic7 18 b3 fiac8 19 Wd2 £>c6 20 Wb2 a6 21 ±e2 tfe7. But im¬ mediately afterwards many pointed out the possibility of the energetic plan with g3-g4 and f4-f5! 16 ficl a6 Karpov recommended 16...fic7, but after 17 b3 Sfc8 18 Wd2 it is not clear what Black can do apart from the scheduled move 18...a6, leading to a position from the game. Perhaps he should have played 16...^c4 17 b3 £>a3 18 !fd2 flc7 19 lft>2 £>b5, trying to exchange pieces, but even after 20 White has an enduring advantage thanks to his greater space and two bishops. 17 b3 Hc7 18 «d2 fifc8 19 g4! i.f8 20 We3\ Karpov avoids the better endgame after 20 ^he2 Hxcl 21 Hxcl fixcl 22 £ixcl ^3c6 23 £M3, since he is aiming for more. Instead he makes an important prophylactic move, re¬ ducing the effectiveness of the counterplay on the c-file. For the essential manoeuvre of his bishop to a3 Black has to block this file with his knight, and then White succeeds in playing f4-£5 and removing his knight from c3 and his rook from the c-file, without in any way dis¬ rupting the coordination of his pieces. 20.. .®ic6 21 fB! ±a3 Kamsky consistently carries out his plan, avoiding a possible sharpening of the play — 21.. .exf5 22 gxf5 Wxf5.

Karpov initially gave 23 ±h3 lfh5 24 Axc8 ±h6 25 tT3 (25 %3 440 Anatoly the Twelfth Axel is hardly any better) 25...Axel 26 Wxh5 gxh5 27 Axb7 but then he refuted his own recommendation in New in Chess by 27...Ab2! 28 Axc6? Axc3 and wins (therefore there only remains 28 4tkll Axd4 with equality). 23 4tte2!P, another idea of Karpov, is more promising — the inclusion of the knight sharply strengthens the attack! Thus if 23.. .Wg4, then 24 9l?hl with the threat of Ah3, while 23...Wh5 24 Wg4 25 &hl Ah6 runs into 26 Ael! ^3e7 27 Hxc7 fixc7 28 Ah3 Wg5 (28...Axf4 29 Hxf4 Wdl 30 ifl) 29 Aa5 fic6 30 Well with the threat of 31 Axb6 2Ixb6 32 Ad7 and Wa5, and that is not all: after 30...Af8 there is also 31 ^d3!, while if 30...Ag7 31 Axb6 flxb6, then 32 Wa5 fic6 33 Wd8+ AfB 34 ^xd5 *g7 35 £>f4 is also good. 22 ficdl £ib4 A natural move, but for an instant it blocks the bishop's path to the kingside. ‘The black pieces are tripping over one another’s feet, which White exploits.’ (Krasenkow) 23 Wh6! 23 is inaccurate on account of 23.. .<2lc2!

The knight paralyses its own rooks, and this frees White’s hands on the kingside. 26 <4h1 ‘Black’s counterplay is temporarily parried, and Karpov unhurriedly (in his best style) be¬ gins preparing for decisive action.’ (Krasen¬ kow) 26...We7 27 Agl £>d7 28 lf3 Wb4 441 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors ‘Black prevents the manoeuvre Bh3 and H16.’ (Karpov) 29 #h6! #f8 30 WgB! #g7 White’s queen has outplayed Black’s, by lur¬ ing it to g7. 30...Wd8 31 Wd2 ®e7 was more tenacious, continuing to look both ways, al¬ though after 32 Bdfl! White would most probably have given his opponent cause to regret his mistake on the 23rd move. 31 ®d2! An impressive queen pendulum!

A completely unexpected decision. Seeing that Black is fairly solid on the kingside, Kar¬ pov finds a paradoxical plan: exploiting the desperate position of the bishop at b2, he opens a second front in the place where nearly all the black pieces are crowded — the queen- side. After the exchange of the rooks — the opponent’s only pieces with any fighting ca¬ pability! — the white queen breaks into the enemy position via the c-file, while the black queen is stuck on the kingside. 38...b4 39 axb4 axb4 40 Bxc2 Sxc2 41 Bf2! Sxf2 42 #xf2 &a3 In the event of 42...Ac3 43 f6 #f8 44 Wc2 Black has to go into a hopeless endgame a pawn down (Karpov), since 44..

In 1993, when Short and I ‘slammed the door’ and against all expectations Karpov re¬ turned to the throne, FIDE decided to set its champion an additional exam, by obliging him 442 Anatoly the Twelfth to begin in the new cycle with a semi-final match of 10 games. And this match took place in February 1995 in the Indian town of Sanghi Nagar. Karpov’s opponent was the talented 26- year-old grandmaster Boris Gelfand — another bright star from the late 1980s-early 1990s, fully comparable with Anand and Ivanchuk. In an interview after my fifth match with Kar¬ pov (1990) I even offered the opinion that in the next qualifying cycle the most dangerous opponent for the ex-champion would in fact be Gelfand. However, it so happened that they met three years later, after Boris had al¬ ready won his second Interzonal tournament (1993) and then defeated Adams and Kramnik in matches. Gelfand must have pinned great hopes on this semi-final match. On his side was a 17- year age difference, which could become a significant factor, in view of the difficult cli¬ matic conditions in India... After two draws at the start, he took the lead by winning the 3rd game in a Caro-Kann with 3 e5 - Karpov has always had difficult relations with this varia¬ tion. But in the very next game, the 4th, Karpov recouped his losses in his favourite symmetri¬ cal ‘Griinfeld’. On this occasion the struggle was more complicated and double-edged, than in his encounter with Kamsky.

However, such play is precisely in Karpov’s style: he can engage in the gradual strengthen¬ ing of his position, seeking weaknesses in the opponent’s camp, and manoeuvre in the expectation of some incautious action. 14 e4 dxe4 15 ^xe4 ^d5 Having gained secure control of the d5- square, Gelfand was hoping possibly to ex¬ ploit the weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. But the defects of Black’s position are also obvious: a weak e6-pawn and passive bishop at g7 which is hard to activate, since ...f6-f5 will weaken the e5-square. 16 Sel (16 £k5 b6 17 £lxd7 lfxd7 is unfa- vourable for White — Ftacnik) 16...b6 17 £c3! Now that the prospect of going to c5 has disappeared, there is nothing for the knight to do on e4 and its return to c3 is perfectly logi¬ cal — the struggle for the d5-square! It is doubtful whether the attempt to put immediate pressure on the e6-pawn by 17 Jk,h3 was any better, since Black defends his weakness without any trouble: 17.jBfc7 18 Bel Bac8 19 4k3 Wd6. But in combination with pressure on d5, this threat will be un¬ pleasant, since it is not so easy for Black to manoeuvre in restricted space. 17...£ice7 18 #b3 (18 Ah3 £k7 Karpov) 18. ..a5 Now, after the natural 18...Bc8, 19 J.h3! was rather good: 19...Sc6 (or 19...f5 20 ^g5 Bc6 21 Ag2) 20 Bad (Ftacnik). Not wanting to endure the queen at b3, Gelfand decides on a weakening of his pawn structure. 19 a3 Karpov never liked to weaken his pawns without necessity. Thus here he prevents the advance ...a5~a4-a3, although after 19 Jth3!? a4 20 Wc2 WcS (Ftacnik) 21 We2 a3 22 £kd5 ^xd5 23 Bad ®e8 24 b3 Black’s problems would have remained unresolved: 24...f5 25 Ag2 Bc8 26 Bxc8 WxcS 27 £>e5, and if 24.. .5.8, then not 25 Bxc8 ®xc8 26 Jtxe6+ Axe6 27 Wxe6+ ®xe6 28 Sxe6 Bc8 with counterplay, but 25 Bc4!, retaining pressure. 19.. .a4 20«fd1 If 20 Wa2 ^xc3 21 bxc3 b5 (with equality - Karpov) 22 4^d2 Bc8 23 <£>e4 the chances are with White, but after 20...Bc8 21 Bad Bc6 (Ftacnik) 22 4^d2 Ae8 Black succeeds in defending his weak pawns: 23 £ic4 Af7, and if 23 4^xd5 exd5 24 b3 (an attempt to exploit the weakness at b6), then 24...fixe 1 25 fixcl g5 is possible, with counterplay on the king- side. 20.. .£ic7 Gelfand replaces the blockading knight: the one from e7 will go to d5, so that the other can defend the e6-pawn from c7. Defending this pawn with the queen leaves White with the advantage: 20...®rb8 21 Jth3 ®d6 22 <£>e4 Wc6 23 Bel ®b5 24 Bc2 £rf5 25 £ic3! (the struggle revolves around the d5-square) 25.. .Wc6 26 &xd5 Wxd5 27 J.g2 Wd6 28 £\d2, preparing a breakthrough in the centre. 20...4ic7 should not be criticised: Black still retains an acceptable game. But it is instructive to observe how Karpov seeks resources, ma¬ noeuvring on the central squares. 21 Bel £ied5 22 £id2! Be8 (after 22...b5 the knight takes a different route — 23 4^de4) 23 <£c4! Af8 24 £>e4 444 Anatoly the Twelfth Karpov unexpectedly changes plan: since he does not consider it useful to exchange his knight at c3, he temporarily stops besieging the d5-point Even so, the logical intensifica¬ tion of this siege by 24 £}e3 would have set Black the most serious problems: 24...jtc6P! 25 £kxd5! Axd5 26 £*xd5 ^xd5 27 Wc2! (stronger than Karpov’s recommendation 27 ffc6) with an obvious advantage, or 24...£}xc3 25 Hxc3 fla7 (anaesthetic, but after Ftacnik’s 25.. .fic8 there follows 26 ®c2, and it is not easy for Black to disentangle himself) 26 h4 with the initiative for White. In the game, by contrast, the retention of the d5-outpost enabled Black to maintain a sound defence. But, on the other hand, with a larger number of pieces on the board Gelfand also has to solve more difficult problems. In the end Karpov’s idea proved justified, since in the subsequent manoeuvring Black did not act in the best way. 24.. .Ab5 25 He2! kel 26 2ec2 2b8 (£)xb6 was threatened) 27 #d2 Hf8?! Black begins what appears to quite a good regrouping: the rook vacates a square for the knight, which goes to g7, in order to cover the king and hinder a possible advance of the h- pawn. But this plan has an obvious drawback: it weakens Black’s control of d5. Gelfand’s desire to move his knight from c7, where it under ‘X-ray’ attack by the white rooks, is un¬ derstandable, but in my opinion 27...Wd7 was clearly preferable — after 28 h4 he could have played either 28...Uec8 29 h5 £k8 30 hxg6 hxg6 31 ^e3 jtc6, or even 28...h5. That is, thanks to his control of d5 Black could never¬ theless have hoped to obtain a normal game. 28 h4! ®e8?! (consistent, although 28...®d7 was again better — even with a loss of tempo!) 29 ®e3 ®g7 30 ®ic3! Returning to the attack on the d5-point. An exchange sacrifice also merits serious consid¬ eration: 30 ^xd5!P exd5 31 ^c3 Jk,c4 (after Ftacnik’s move 31...jtc6 White has the strong reply 32 Hfe2l, when it is hard for Black to hold his a4- and d5-pawns) 32 £>xa4 Jtb3 33 ^hc3 (Karpov), and if 33...^xc2, then 34 JSxc2! In any event White will pick up the d5- pawn and have excellent compensation. But Karpov wants to achieve more! 30...£ixc3 Black is forced to give up his outpost. In the event of 30...jtc6 31 4kxd5 Jtxd5 32 43xd5 exd5 33 Wd3 b5 34 W(3 (Ftacnik) he would have lost a very important pawn. 31 2xc3 g5!? Realising that the quiet development of events does not promise him anything, Boris decides to open up the play on the kingside. 32 hxg5 Now the dangerous breakthrough 32 d5!P is parried by 32...gxf4 33 gxf4 sfehS, and the weakening of the white king gives Black counter-chances. 445 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 32...fxg5 33 £ig4 gxf4 34 gxf4 ±d6?! Ftacnik recommended attacking the f4- pawn in another way — 34...£\h5!? This would in fact have set White somewhat more diffi¬ cult problems. Analysis diagram 35 £5!? ex£5 36 Wh6!

This monumental game had a decisive in¬ fluence on the further course of the match: by winning in good style, Karpov not only lev¬ elled the scores, but also undermined Gel- fand’s belief in his ultimate success. After a draw in the 5th game, Boris lost the 6th, and after it also the 7th — with White in a Queen’s Indian Defence. When he sealed his 61st move, he still retained hopes of saving himself in a very interesting bishop endgame, but on the resumption he committed an impercepti¬ ble error as early as the 63rd move, and Kar¬ pov created a genuine Sanghi Nagar study! Later he was to say: 'This adjourned position was the most complicated in my career.’ After gaining a draw in the 8th game and also winning the 9th, Karpov won the match ahead of schedule by the convincing score 6-3. Now he faced a final encounter with Gata Kamsky, who had crushed Valery Salov in the other semi-final... 'Tournament of his Life' When talking about Karpov’s upsurge after his return to the FIDE throne, everyone im¬ mediately remembers his phenomenal triumph in Linares 1994. However, before this is de¬ scribed, it should be mentioned that no less successful for him in the creative sense was the 1992 tournament in Biel, which took place just three months after his ill-fated match with Short. We are already familiar with one game from there {Game No.96), and here is another striking example. Game 102 A.Karpov-A.Beliavsky Biel 1992, 5th round 1 e4 In the 1990s Karpov would mainly 'serve from the right’ only against a specific oppo¬ nent. Thus in the given instance he probably took into account Beliavsky’s predilection for the Breyer Variation, which at one time he 44 7 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors himself used to happily play for both sides. 1 ...e5 2 £>f3 £hc6 3 ±bS a6 4 ±a4 £if6 5 0-0 ±e7 6 fiel b5 7 ±b3 d6 8 c3 0-0 9 h3 £ib8 10 d4 (10 d3 - Game No.51) 10.. .£>bd7 11 £>bd2 £b7 12 Ac2 Se8 13 a4 This move, which first occurred back in 1964 in a game between two Moscow masters, became internationally known only nine years later (cf. the following note).

Jtf8 (14...d5l?) 15 ^g3 g6 16 b3 JLg7 17 dxe5 with a quick draw, but after 17 d5! the traditional ‘Spanish torture’ would have awaited Black 14 JLd3 Hoping to restrict the opponent’s actions by pressure on the b5-pawn. 14...C6 The position of the bishop at d3 gives Black the opportunity for a freeing advance in the centre: 14...b4 15 a5 d5!? 16 exd5 exd4 17 fixe8 Wxe8 18 c4 <Sk5 (Khalifman-Beliavsky, Leningrad 1990). The recent game Hazne- daroglu-Short (Izmir 2004) confirmed that this is perfectly acceptable for Black: 19 <5fb3 <5fxd3 20 Wxd3 c6 21 dxc6 Wxc6 22 <5fbxd4 Wc7 with sufficient counterplay for the pawn. Another version of the pawn sacrifice — 14.. .exd4 15 cxd4 c5 (Spassky-Karpov, Tilburg 1983) — did not become established in tour¬ nament play. 15 b3 After the standard 15 £ffl Beliavsky twice successfully solved his opening problems by 15.. .d5 16 JLg5 dxe4 17 Bxe4 Ae7 — against Balashov (56th USSR Championship, Odessa 1989) and Anand (Linares 1992). 15.. .g6 Here 15...d5P! leads to the loss of a pawn after 16 exd5, for example: 16...^xd5 17 dxe5 5 (17...^xc3? 18 #c2) 18 Wc2 £kd3 19 Wxd3 b4 (19...£if4 20 Wf5) 20 c4 £k3 21 Wc2! c5 22 Jtb2 etc. 16#c2 ±g7 16...flc8!P is interesting: 17 «Jtb2 ^h5 (it is too early for 17...exd4P! 18 cxd4 d5 19 e5 4^h5 on account of 20 e6!

Black even seizes the initiative (Bezgodov-Balashov, Perm 1997). 17£b2 £}h5 18 Afl Wb6 Up till now both sides have been manoeu¬ vring in accordance with time-tested prescrip¬ tions. 19 b4! Apparently, Karpov had this novelty in mind when he played 1 e4. White seizes space 448 Anatoly the Twelfth on the queenside, prepares c3-c4, and above all restricts Black’s activity. This is typical of Karpov, who in almost every game was able to find an arrangement of his pieces which would enable him to restrict the opponent’s possibilities and at the same time unhurriedly strengthen his own position. 20 dxe5 It was possible to maintain the tension — 20 4ib3 Sac8 21 Sadi 4ie6 22 4ia5 Jta8 23 @)3 Hcd8 24 Wa2 (A.Sokolov-Notkin, Elista 1994), but Karpov prefers to clarify the situa¬ tion. The point of this is revealed slighdy later. 20.. .4bxe5 If 20...dxe5 21 c4 (Karpov) 21...bxa4, then 22 c5 #xb4 23 ±a3 WaS 24 £lc4 Wc7 25 <?M6 is good for White, or else 22 ttxa4, and it is hard for Black to prevent a subsequent bind: 22...a5? will not do on account of 23 bxa5! Wxb2 24 fiebl Wc3 25 Scl! 21 ®xe5 dxe5 Black is forced to shut in his bishop, since he fails to equalise after 21...Jtxe5 22 ^£3 (22 c4!?) 22..Ag7 23 Wd2 (Karpov). 22 c4 In contrast to its opposite number, the bishop at b2 becomes active, and Black is faced with solving some difficult strategic problems. 22.. .2ad8 Activating the bishop at b7 by 22...c5 is un¬ favourable in view of 23 cxb5! cxb4 24 a5 Wf6 25 b6. Beliavsky is concerned about the uncer¬ tain state of his queenside pawns, and he pro¬ vokes c4-c5, stabilising the pawn structure. 23 axb5! After 23 c5 Wcl 24 ^b3 Jlc8 things would have been easier for Black than in the game. Karpov tries to achieve more, by exploiting the weakness of the b5-pawn. 23.. .axb5?! Hoping to find work for the bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal, but this hope is not destined to be realised. 23...cxb5! was bolder, opening up the b7-bishop and enlivening the play. In this case playing against the weakness of the b5-pawn after 24 cxb5 axb5 promises White little. Karpov recommended 24 g3 ^e6 25 c5 or immediately 24 c5! HT6 25 Be3 — in my opinion, 25 Ha3 is more accurate, while if 24.. .We6, then 25 ^B!, inhibiting ...f7-f5 (25-.fi? 26 ftg5 We7 27 Wb3+ £>e6 28 c6) and maintaining the initiative after 25...h6 26 Ha3. 24 Sa5! (now Black has no time to think about the future of his bishop at b7) 24...J.f8 After 24...bxc4 25 £>xc4 #c7 (25...#xb4?! 26 ftbll) Karpov suggested 26 g3 with a 4±’ sign, apparently reckoning that 26...4ie6 sim¬ ply loses a pawn: 27 jtxe5 Jtxe5 28 Hxe5. However, after 28...c5 29 bxc5 <?M4 (29...f6 is sharper: 30 Bxe6!

Bxd6 38 ±xb5 Bdl+ 39 *h2 Bal 40 Bxal Axal 41 a6 Jtd4 etc. Karpov found a more interesting possibil¬ ity, involving the strategic plan of shutting in the bishop at b7 and exploiting his spatial ad¬ vantage. At the same time Black even acquires a passed pawn in the centre, supported by the rook at d8, and the rook at e8 comes into play. But Karpov calculated that the activity of the black pieces would be temporary, whereas White’s activity, in view of the threat of ad¬ vancing the e-pawn and opening up the posi¬ tion of the black king, would be far more long-term and dangerous. 26.. .4.4 27 ±xd4 exd4 28 c5 Wc7 For complete happiness Black only needs to make one more move — ... Jlc8, and it is hard to imagine that he will not in fact manage to make it. 29Ba7!®b8 To inhibit the advance of the white e-pawn, Beliavsky tries to activate his d-pawn. In fact 29.. .jtg7 30 e5 (Karpov) would have been quite acceptable for Black: 30...Wb8 31 Wa2 Bd5 (31,..d3? 32 e6), and the invasion 32 Va5 Be7 33 Wb6 is not fatal for him — 33...d3 34 Bdl d2 35 g3 (it is no better to play 35 Bxd2 Bxd2 36 %4xd2 Jtxe5, and if 37 <S^e4?, then 37..

Karpov) 31. „d2 With this and his next move Beliavsky maintains material equality, but this leads to a rapid collapse. It would seem that, by aban¬ doning the pawn to its fate — 31..Jtg7!? 32 Hxd3 (32 ±xd3 Wf4) 32...fixd3 33 ±xd3 JLc8, he could have made things much harder for his opponent 32 ^xd2 Hd4? This essentially loses by force! The best practical chance was again to try and set up a defence a pawn down: 32... JLc8 33 <S3f3 Jle6. Now too, at first sight, things are not so bad for Black: a pawn is attacked, his queen wants to leap to f4, and his bishop has not lost hope of reaching e6. But Karpov’s next move shows that these are not real intentions, but belated dreams. 33 e5! 2xb4 (not 33...Hxe5? 34 HxeS Wxe5 because of the fork 35 4^£3) 34 e6! Very energetic. The swift invasion of the opponent’s position brings White an impres¬ sive win. 34 ^3e4 appears stronger, when if 34...Se6 (34...®xe5? 35 ^3g5!) White has the paralysing 35 ?M6.

After 37 Wc2 Bxe6 38 Bxe6 Black can transfer his heavy pieces to the field of battle, but his light-squared bishop, stuck on the queenside, is unable to render any assistance: if 38...

In time-trouble Black blunders a rook, but. 451 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors in view of the unavoidable invasion of the knight at f6 or d6, there was no longer any way of saving the game: 38.. Jtg7(h6) 39 ^3d6! etc. 39 #e5+ 1-0 The bishop at b7 is a silent reproach to Black’s strategy. Karpov’s accurate and confi¬ dent play at the most tense moment of the game creates a great impression. In this double-round tournament of eight grandmasters Karpov twice(!) defeated Korchnoi and Shirov, and in the end he fin¬ ished first by a big margin — IOV2 out of 14 (+8—1=5). It is evident that he was striving to demonstrate to himself and to the whole world that it was rather early to write him off... And in Linares (February-March 1994), now the FIDE world champion, he tried his utmost to show that his official title, acquired in the match with Timman, Veighed’ no less that my historic title, confirmed by my victory over Short. Karpov had one other powerful stimulus: of all the traditional super-toumaments in which he had ever taken part, for some reason he had been least successful in Linares: 1st- 2nd (1981), 2nd-3rd (1983), 2nd (1989), 7th- 8th (1991), 4th (1992), and 2nd-3rd (1993). Moreover, in 1992 and 1993 I had finished first with the identical result of 10 out of 13, while Karpov had correspondingly finished 2Vi and IV2 points behind me. As V. and I.Iinder write, ‘it would appear that all these comparative failures stirred up in him a pas¬ sionate desire to win the Linares tournament, which by this time had become a kind of lit¬ mus test of “who’s who” in the chess world.’ As it later transpired, a far from unimpor¬ tant role was played by the pairings, which placed us alongside each other: I drew No. 10 and Karpov No.ll. Thus all the participants except one (Lautier) had to play us in turn. Averbakh: It may be that this is the secret of Karpov’s superb result: his opponents, who had just grappled with Kasparov, were pretty much worn out.’ However, the miracle that occurred can hardly be explained by this or by the staggering good fortune which accompa¬ nied the FIDE champion from the very start. ‘One’s mood is affected by luck,’ — Karpov was to say after the tournament. This thought was confirmed in the very first round, when with Black in a time scramble he snatched victory against Lautier. 39.. .1.e4?! (instead of the calm 39...£kl8) 40 ®xc6? With the simple 40 ^e5! fxeS 41 jtxe4 exf4 42 Wxc6 fxg3+ 43 <4>xg3 White would have forced a draw from a position of strength — 43...fld8 (Karpov). 40.. .#xc6 41 2xc6 £idxf4!

Bareev equalised, but five moves before the time control, now in a dead-drawn position, he inexplicably 452 Anatoly the Twelfth blundered a rook, allowing mate in one move! So, we both started with two wins, and in the 3rd round we both had Black: I made a draw with Topalov, but Karpov played the opening badly against Hlescas and then... trapped his queen in the middle of the board! 26 JLb4? (26 g4 was essential) 26...a5! 27 Ae7 e5! (a surprise: if 28 dxe5?, then 28...g5! and wins) 28 lfh4 exd4 29 lff4 dxe3 30 ttxe3 d4, and although Black later lost his advantage, Illescas missed a way to draw and the passed d-pawn decided matters. In the 4th round I managed to beat Ivan¬ chuk in impressive style, but Karpov also seri¬ ously warmed up, prettily crushing Topalov. This game was deemed the best in the 60th volume of Informator and, along with Game Nos.67, 71 and 79 it rightly found its way into the well-known book The World’s Greatest Chess Games. 18 £ic5! dxc5 (18.Jfce8 19 £>xe6! fke6 20 fixe6 is also bad for Black) 19 #xd7 Sc8 20 Sxe6!

(Karpov: ‘A rare occurrence — for the third successive time a rook is sacrificed! *) 28...Sxd4 29 ttf6+, and White won (1-0). In the 5th round I beat Judit Polgar, while Karpov received a ‘generous gift’ from Ivan¬ chuk, who after a favourable opening sud¬ denly began to ‘drift’ and, after blundering an important pawn on the 28th move, prompdy resigned. In the 6th round with difficulty I saved a half point in my game with Gelfand, while Karpov technically defeated Polgar after employing a ‘special weapon’: 1 e4 c5 2 c3!? e6 3 d4 d5 4 exd5 exd5 5 <?3f3 ^c6 6 Jtb5 c4?! 7 £le5! Wb6 8 ±xc6+ bxc6 9 0-0 Ad6 10 b3! etc. In connection with this game, the words of Igor Zaitsev come to mind: ‘Every out¬ standing grandmaster has his own chess vi¬ sion, his chess compass, which in the opening does not allow him to go against his inner convictions. Thus Kapengut with Black tried to tempt Karpov with the Modem Benoni, while Sveshnikov tried to persuade him to dip into the quietly flowing waters of the 2 c3 variation in the Sicilian Defence — but all their efforts were in vain!’ And for Judit alone did he make an exception... Before the 7th round, in which we played each other, Karpov had 6 out of 6(!), with me a point behind. I had the white pieces, and it was clear that this was the decisive game of the tournament. My trainer Yuri Dokhoian and I spent a long time racking our brains over how to try and breach the Caro-Kann Defence on this occasion. In it I won twice against Karpov in Amsterdam (1988) and twice in Linares (1992 and 2001), but on this occasion, in 1994, something went wrong, and evidendy I burned myself out even while pre¬ paring for the game. After a badly played 453 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors opening I then even had to save myself] Aver¬ bakh: "While in the previous two Linares tour¬ naments it was his victories over Karpov that, to a large extent, determined Kasparov’s ulti¬ mate success, this time it was a case of “dia¬ mond cut diamond”: the game was drawn and the gap remained unchanged.’ In the 8th round I drew with Shirov, but in time-trouble the inspired leader outplayed Gelfand in a complicated position, although on the 37th move the latter could have set his opponent difficult problems. In the 9th round Karpov failed to win a better ending against Shirov, while I managed to beat Kamsky and to reduce the deficit: I now had 7 points, but Karpov had 8! In the 10th round — a rare occurrence — luck deserted my rival: after gaining an end¬ game with an extra pawn and winning chances against Kamsky, he threw away the advantage with his hasty 33rd move... However, this did not help me: trying at all costs to win with Black against the new star of Russian chess Vladimir Kramnik, I played the King’s Indian Defence too riskily, overstepped the mark, came under attack and lost. In Averbakh’s opinion, "The question of first place was effectively decided by Kramnik: after defeating Kasparov, in the next round he lost to Karpov.’ Before the game Vladimir, who was then not yet 19 years old, stated in an interview: "In this tournament Karpov has been very aggressive, often going in for dubi¬ ous positions. If he plays like this against me, I have a chance of beating him.’ But Karpov did not give him such a chance. Game 103 A. Karpov-V.

It is interesting that a position with the same forces — rook, knight and two pawns (at g6 and h5) against rook, knight and g7-pawn, but with the knight at g8 — occurred in the game Kramnik-Krasenkow (Wijk aan Zee 2003) and also ended in a win for White. After this win the fate of the tournament was finally decided. Subsequently Karpov made a draw with Anand and crushed Be- liavsky in a Catalan. He was always a difficult opponent for the famous Ukrainian grand¬ master, as is indicated by Game Nos.98 and 102, as well as the overall score of their meet¬ ings since 1973: +16—3=10 in favour of Ana¬ toly Evgenyevich. Thus was achieved one of the most out¬ standing tournament results in the history of chess: 1. Karpov — 11 out of 13 (+9=4); 2-3. Kasparov and Shirov — 8V2; 4. Bareev — 7Vi; 5- 6. Kramnik and Lautier — 7; 7-9. Anand, Kam- sky and Topalov - 6V2; 10. Ivanchuk — 6, etc. When I had not yet cooled down after the battle, I stated: "This competitive triumph, in my view, was not supported by outstanding play. I have seen Karpov play better. Now he has found an optimal manner of play, which, by virtue of his personal and playing qualities, enables him to achieve the maximum results with the minimal expenditure of nervous en¬ ergy. A kind of apotheosis of pragmatism!5 The reaction of the chess world was summed up by Averbakh: ‘The super- tournament in Linares ended sensationally: Karpov's result brings to mind the legendary successes of Alekhine at San Remo (1930) and Bled (1931), and Botvinnik's triumph in the 1945 USSR Championship (+13=4). Equally sensational was Karpov's unprecedented start: six out of six! It seems that the tide of FIDE world champion has given him renewed con¬ fidence in his powers. This year Kasparov exacdy repeated Karpov's 1993 result, but Karpov leaped head and shoulders above him!' As the statisticians reported, this was already his 125th tournament victory! After this "tournament of his life' Karpov apparentiy decided that he had now demon¬ strated everything to everyone, and he even made a bold statement in the press: "Yes, I would like to play yet another match with Kasparov, but now he needs this match more than I do.' However, Karpov's tournament successes soon began to decline: in April in Dos Her- manas he conceded first place to Gelfand, and in May in Las Palmas to Kamsky (each time scoring +4-1=4), and in the autumn he en¬ countered great problems at the double-round "Sicilian' super-toumament in Buenos Aires, where he only shared 5th-6th places with Kamsky, behind Salov, Anand, Ivanchuk and Polgar. The participants in this unusual tournament were obliged to begin their games with 1 e4 c5 2 £}f3 and then 3 d4 cxd4 4 <53xd4 — only an Open Sicilian! This was an original way of marking the 60th birthday of the outstanding grandmaster Lev Polugayevsky. Although Po- lugayevsky's name is associated with an enor¬ mous number of novelties, scattered around various sections of chess theory, his contribu¬ tion to the development of the Sicilian De¬ fence has been the most impressive,' wrote Zaitsev. 458 Anatoly the Twelfth Later, after praising the play of the tourna¬ ment winners, Karpov’s long-standing trainer commented with his customary tact: 'The more modest results of the remaining partici¬ pants can largely be justified by the absence (or loss) of the Sicilian skills necessary for such a fierce battle.’ I think that'we have to respect Karpov’s courage, in deciding to test his strength in what was perhaps his most dif¬ ficult ‘field of work’. In Linares 1995, where I, Kramnik and An- and did not play, he finished second (+5=8) behind the brilliantly performing Ivanchuk (+7=6), while the result of the double-round Linares 2001 reflected the inexorable march of time: L Kasparov — IV2 out of 10; 2-6. Kar¬ pov... — 4Y2. King of FIDE The contesting of the world championship in the mid-1990s was undoubtedly the most in¬ tensive and unusual in the history of chess. The challengers battled simultaneously in two series, trying to qualify in the PCA series for a match with me, and in the FIDE series for a match with Karpov. Moreover, according to a peace treaty between FIDE and the PCA, concluded during the Olympiad and Congress in Moscow (1994), a ‘unification’ match for the crown was also envisaged. The favourites in both series were the al¬ ready experienced 25-year-old Indian Vishy Anand and the rapidly improving 20-year-old ‘new American’ Gata Kamsky. In January 1994 they distinguished themselves in FIDE matches: Anand beat Yusupov, and Kamsky beat Van der Sterren (in each case by 4V2-2y2). In June both convincingly won their PCA matches: Anand against Romani shin (5-2) and Kamsky against Kramnik (4V2-IV2). And then in July a random draw brought them together in a FIDE quarter-final match. This was a fierce battle! Vishy threw away an obvious advantage in the 1st game and a sim¬ ple win in the 2nd, then he nevertheless scored two wins and was very close to success in the 5th game, but he delayed and by tena¬ cious defence Gata saved half a point. The match was the best of eight games, and it could well have concluded ahead of schedule... True, the score of 3V2-IY2 also did not herald a sensation. But here something broke down in Anand’s well-regulated mechanism (this also happened to him in his matches with me and Karpov). The exceptionally strong-willed Kamsky levelled the scores (4-4) and — miraculously! — finished off his demoralised opponent in the tie-break by 2-0, and this against one of the acknowledged kings of rapidplay chess! ‘Kamsky has undoubtedly developed as a player, and his qualitative progress is obvious,’ Karpov declared after this. ‘But it is my firm conviction that the result of his two matches — with Kramnik and Anand — lies in the field of psychology. The downfall of both Gata’s opponents was caused by the fact that they did not take him seriously...’ But in the September PCA semi-final match, inspired by his success, Gata literally massacred Short (5Y2-1V2) — who had been the ‘No.l’ challenger of the previous cycle. How¬ ever, Anand too did not grieve for long after his disappointing defeat in the FIDE cycle: in the other semi-final he crushed Adams by the same score — and again had to meet Kamsky, only this time in the PCA final! Less than a month after this severe test, in February 1995, in an almost offhand manner (again 5V2-1V2) Kamsky made short work of Salov in a semi-final FIDE match, which also looked impressive, as earlier his opponent had knocked out Khalifman and Timman. However, Gata was unable to beat the ‘In¬ dian miracle-worker’ a second time: on this occasion, despite losing on time in a winning position in the first game, Vishy dominated throughout and won the final PCA match (6y2-4y2). Thus my next opponent in the match for the world championship (New York, autumn 1995) became Anand, and I defeated him in a 459 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors severe struggle: 10V2-IV2 (+4—1=13). And in the final FIDE world championship match (Elista, summer 1996) Karpov did not leave Kamsky any hopes — also \OV2-lV2 (but +6— 3=9). It is evident that Karpov ‘took Gata seri¬ ously’. Although, initially the outcome of this match of 20 games seemed unclear and puz¬ zling: would the long-standing occupant of the chess summit be able to withstand the on¬ slaught of the staggeringly purposeful leader of the new generation? In this respect Kamsky vividly resembled the young Karpov. But what he definitely lacked was Karpov’s flexibility and depth of positional evaluation, which ul¬ timately decided the match. Gata was not even helped by the fact that his opponent was a whole 23 years older... And yet Kamsky was pinning enormous hopes on this match! Back in 1994 reports had appeared in the press that by one or other course — PCA or FIDE (or perhaps both!) he would definitely ‘get through to Kasparov’. Now he had only one chance left — to beat Karpov. And, unusually for him, he even took a lengthy break from playing, devoting a lot of time to preparation. In the match Gata em¬ ployed many varied openings, evidently hop¬ ing that Karpov would no longer be capable of following the rapidly changing evaluations of modem variations. However, despite all his preparation, and his extraordinary hard work, persistence and will-power, Kamsky was un¬ able to put up a genuinely serious resistance against the champion. The very first game, won by Karpov in his favourite positional style, demonstrated his obvious superiority in manoeuvring. True, Kamsky impressively won the 2nd. Such a start was traditional for the ‘king of FIDE’: he also began with a win and a loss in his match with Timman (1993) and also subsequently with Anand (1998). There then followed a 50-move draw, and in the 4th game Karpov gained convincing revenge for his defeat in the 2nd: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 £}f6 5 ^c3 e6 6 ^f3 ±b4 1 cxd5 <£ixd5 8 ±d2 £>c6 9 ±d3 0-0 10 0-0 ±e7 11 #e2 £if6 12 <£ie4 Wb6\?

The press wrote about Karpov’s play: ‘Elis manoeuvring strategy proved hard for his 22- year-old opponent to understand.’ After this win the champion maintained his lead throughout and in the subsequent games he dictated matters. And whereas a sharp opening skirmish in the 5th game led to a rapid draw, it is highly probable that the amaz¬ ing events in the 6th game undermined Ham- sky’s belief in his ultimate success.

The main line was and still is 8 c4! (cf. Volume 4> Game No.48, note to White’s 6th move). 8.. .#h4 Karpov thought about this risky sortie for 460 Anatoly the Twelfth 42 minutes.

This move, like 10...Wg4, was made instantly — it was all de¬ cided while Black was considering his 8th move. ‘The loss of castling does at all not concern the present-day Karpov.5 (Beliavsky, Mikhalchishin). Wouldn’t you agree that in some way this resembles the bold and unusual playing manner of Steinitz and Lasker? The normal ll.Jsi?f8 would have led after 12 Jte2 ®£5 (Magem-Illescas, Pamplona 1995) 13 fibl! followed by c3-c4 to problems for Black in view of the disrupted coordina¬ tion of his pieces. It appears that after the un¬ usual move in the game it will be even harder for him to connect his rooks. But Karpov thinks that the most important thing is to bring his h8-rook into play quickly, and then connect the rooks later, in an original way. And, what is very typical, is that he succeeds in carrying out his audacious idea! 12±e2 Kamsky, naturally, tries to punish his op¬ ponent with the queens on White can hope for an attack.

Karpov) 13...b6 In the event of ^...^cS 14 c4 dxc4 15 Jtxc4 h5 16 h4 Black would have remained in difficulties, and so he sticks to a different plan. 14 c4 dxc4 (14..x6?! 15 c5! and c2-c4 Kar¬ pov) 15 jLxc4 Se8l After 15...h5 16 Ad3 Vg4 17 ±e2 and Jtf3!

After 16 2xe8+ sfexeS 17 JLd3 (17 lfe2+ &f8 is equal) 17...»d5 18 c4 ®xd4 19 Jtb2 Wg4 (M.Gurevich) the position of the black king in the centre is invulnerable, and White probably has nothing better than to exchange queens and regain the pawn, with a roughly equal endgame. 16...±c6! An important move: the threat of...Jtf3(e4) 461 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors forces White to block the long diagonal. ‘At the cost of two tempi Black averts the break¬ through c2-c4-c5.’ (Karpov) 17 d5 Of course, not 17 Jtfl? Wd5. But now the d5~pawn restricts the mobility of White’s light- squared bishop, while the black bishop at d6 becomes not only a strong defensive piece, but also in some cases an attacking one! 17.,.=&.d7 18 Afl?! It would appear that Gata did not imagine how Black would solve the problem of com¬ pleting his development, and believed that he had sufficient time to prepare an attack. Therefore, not seeing for the moment an ac¬ tive plan, he makes ‘good-quality5 moves. According to Karpov, the only way of cast¬ ing doubts on Black’s idea was the sharp 18 Jtd3! In the event of 18...#xd5 19 c4 it is hard to Black to safeguard his king: after 19...#a5? there follows 20 c5! Jtxc5 21 Jtb5 ±d6 22 #d5 Sb8 23 ±g5+ f6 24 flxe8+ jtxe8 25 Jtd2 #a3 26 Jtb4, winning the queen, while if 19...1Hre5, then 20 h4 66 (20...<4’c8 21 c5) 21 JLxh7 is strong. White would have gained an obvious ad¬ vantage after 18...#66 19 #d2 h6 20 Jta6!, for example: 20...c5 21 dxc6 ixc6 22 c4 <4)c7 23 c5, or 22...Se6 23 Af4 2xel+ 24 fixel 4>c7 25 #xd6+! #xd6 26 Ie7+ ±d7 27 ±h5 Sd8 28 Jtxd6+ 4?xd6 29 2xf7 and wins. His advantage would be less noticeable af¬ ter 18...#g4! If now 19 jLe2 #g6 20 c4, then Black can force a draw: 20...Sxe3 21 fxe3 Ji,xg3 22 Jtd3 JLxh2+ 23 4?xh2 #h6+. But after 19 #d2 his problems remain: 19...h6 20 c4, or 19...a5 20 Afl (20 Ae2 #5 21 Ad4) 20.. .5e7 21 jLd4 with some initiative. 18.. .h6 A far from obvious prelude to a highly ef¬ fective regrouping. It was also possible to play the immediate 18...Be7 19 c4 4?e8 20 Jtd3 #65 (20...#h3 21 c5! bxc5 22 #c2 is less good), but all the same the move ...h7-h6 is necessary, so that in certain variations the 167- pawn should not be hanging and the g5- square should be covered, for example: 21 #d2 <4>f8?

Then White’s initiative will quickly evaporate, and a slighdy inferior endgame will await him. For the mo¬ ment Kamsky has time to avoid such a devel¬ opment of events. But the question is, does he sense the approach of the critical moment? 20 ±d3 White, to his misfortune, also devises a re¬ grouping, aiming to prevent the black king from hiding on the kingside. It appears to Kamsky that, by creating the queen and bishop battery along the bl-h7 diagonal, he will disclose the defects in Black’s position and the king at f8 will not be safe. But this proves to be an illusion! 20 JLg2 (Karpov) was hardly any better — Black would have carried out the same plan: 20.. .4?e8 21 #d4 #g6 (21...4>f8? 22 ±xh6 ±e5 23 #h4 gxh6? 24 d6!) 22 #c3 <&f8 23 c5 dxc5 24 j|.xc5 Jtxc5 25 #xc5 #d6, and a draw after 26 #xd6 cxd6 27 flxe7 <4)xe7 28 JSb7 i*d8 29 ifl Hc8 30 fixa7 Hc5 would have been the quite logical outcome. 20.. .#f6 21 *g2?! Kamsky continues to avoid simplification, not believing that Black’s slow plan can go unpunished. ‘The impression is that White has 462 mixed up his pieces: instead of placing the bishop on its lawful square g2, he has occu¬ pied this square with his king.’ (Karpov) 21 Wc2 9l?e8 22 c5 bxc5 23 Jtxc5 is more active, and in the event of 23...

He has an un¬ canny ability to coordinate his forces so that they are at their most efficient. Notice how he has arranged his pieces so that they do not stand in each other’s way, and they are all pro¬ tected; there appears not to be a single weak¬ ness in his whole army. Compare this position with the one where he played ll.-.^dS; it is hard to imagine that he would be able to achieve such harmony. With his king safe, his rooks doubled and White’s kingside weak¬ ened, the initiative has passed over to Kar¬ pov.’ Indeed, Black’s position is now preferable. 463 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors And for White in such cases, after the great efforts spent searching for attacking continua¬ tions, it can be very difficult to readjust and defend. Through inertia he makes active moves, which often lead to disaster... 26 #d3? Gata is still dreaming of the threats that his queen and bishop battery will create...

This must have come as an ice-cold shower for Kamsky!

After such wanderings by the black king, it was hard to imagine that it would all end in a lighting and irresistible at¬ tack on... the white king, fit would appear that Kamsky did not in fact fully realise what had happened on the board.’ (Karpov) Then the champion also won the 7th game, which lasted nearly seven hours and 71 moves, and after a draw in the 8th he also won the 9th! The score became crushing 6V2- 2V2. But here, to his honour, Gata managed to display his fighting qualities, and in the second half of the match there was an equal and fierce struggle. Karpov gained his sixth win in the 14th game (as though paying tribute to the memory of unlimited matches), and after the 18th he gathered the necessary IOV2 points. It need hardly be said how great a disap¬ pointment this was for the Kamskys — Gata and his strict father Rustem, who had devoted all their efforts to the achievement of the su¬ preme goal. Soon, on the insistence of his fa¬ ther, this talented grandmaster gave up playing chess for a long time and began seriously studying medicine... Meanwhile, on 23rd August 1996, at a four¬ way meeting between myself, Karpov, the FIDE President Kirs an Ilyumzhinov and the President of the Russian Chess Federation Audrey Makarov, it was decided that in 1997 a Kasparov-Karpov match ‘for the absolute championship’ would be held, and a few days 464 Anatoly the Twelfth later we put our signatures to a corresponding memorandum. I will not delve into the question of why our sixth match did not in fact take place (I will express my viewpoint in my autobiogra¬ phy), but a far from minor role in this was played by the result of a double-round super- tournament of the six strongest players in the world in Las Palmas (December 1996): 1. Kasparov — 6Y2 out of 10; 2. Anand — SV2; 3-4. Topalov and Kramnik — 5; 5-6. Ivanchuk and Karpov — 4. In this category 21 tournament, a record for that time and comparable perhaps with the epochal AVRO tournament (1938), Anatoly Evgenyevich, after losing in the second half to Anand and me, was the only contestant who did not score a single win. Of course, he could and should have played better, if he had shown his full commitment to the tournament and had he not gone off at the height of the struggle to the opening of some junior cham¬ pionship in Paris. Here one can't help remem¬ bering Capablanca, who during the Moscow international tournament (1925) also travelled to another city — Leningrad, to give a simulta¬ neous display, and suffered a defeat after his return. After this, all that was left for Karpov was to defend his tide of FIDE champion. Pre¬ cisely at that time, on the instigation of Hyumzhinov, under the pretext of making it livelier and more of a spectacle, the title of world champion began to be contested in knock-out tournaments, with 128 participants playing mini-matches of two games (at the later stages — four and six). In the event of the scores being equal, matters were decided by a tie-break: rapidplay chess, and if necessary even blitz. Of course, I was not against the system it¬ self, on which the famous first international tournament was held (London 1851), but I — and not only I! — thought that it was good only for a World Cup type of event, and abso¬ lutely unsuitable for determining the strongest player on the planet Therefore, when Karpov and I (‘in the aims of overall conciliation') were invited to join in at the semi-final stage (a serious privilege!) I declined to play as a matter of principle, not wishing to create a precedent which would cause damage to the historic title of world champion. But then FIDE allowed Karpov directly into the super-final(!), despite the protests of many well-known grandmasters — Kramnik even refused to participate... A ‘minor' detail: the participants in the super-final received the lion’s share of the overall five million prize fund: $1.37 million went to the winner, and $768,000 to the loser. The main stage of the first FIDE world championship held on the knock-out system took place from 9-30 December 1997 in Groningen and brought a deserved triumph to Vishy Anand. On the way to his goal he de¬ feated Nikolic (2-0), Khalifman (1-1; rapid- play: 2V2-IV2), Almasi (2-0), Shirov (IY2-Y2), Gelfand (IY2-Y2) and Adams (2-2; rapidplay: 2-2; blitz: 1-0). And already in Lausanne on 1st January 1998 — just imagine! — the opening took place of his super-final match with Kar¬ pov, who had flown in to there from the Ca¬ nary Islands... It has to be said that Karpov spoke very re¬ spectfully about the play of the Indian grand¬ master: ‘His genius lies in his originality. An¬ and stands out among the many whom I have played against, and sticks in the memory. Here there is something special, Eastern, unfamiliar to us. We probably have a different view not only of life, but also the chessboard...’ The fact that Vishy also has a different view of life was also clear from his interview after Groningen, in which he stated: d think that we should enter the 21st century, forgetting about privi¬ leges, and play normal world championships.' So, the chess world witnessed FIDE's un¬ precedented ‘Lausanne experiment’ — a match of six games between the freshly relaxed 46- year-old Karpov and the 28-year-old Anand, exhausted by three weeks of struggle. 465 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors Game 105 A.Karpov-V.Anand FIDE World Championship Match, Lausanne 1998,1st game Semi-Slav Defence D48 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 £ic3 £>f6 4 e3 e6 5 £tf3 £ibd7 6 Ad3 In their Candidates match (1991), in Biel (1997) and in the 5th game of the match in Lausanne, Karpov played 6 Wc2 against An- and (Game Nos.95 and 96), but on the whole Black was able to solve his opening problems. 6.. .dxc4 7 ±xc4 b5 8 ±63 ±b7 This move of Larsen occurred most fre¬ quently in the TMeran’ encounters between these two opponents.

We must acknowledge Anand’s courage and class: in the 2nd game he levelled the scores, in the 3rd he gained a draw in the £Meran’, and he was undoubtedly hoping to build on his success in the 4th. But that day something went wrong for him in the opening. After failing to gain an advantage, Vishy handled the middlegame uncertainly and ended up in a rather unpleas¬ ant situation, demanding of White a painstak¬ ing defence. Whereas Karpov, who was in his element, sought the slightest chances of play¬ ing for a win. After the rooks were exchanged on the 32nd move, an endgame was reached with queens and opposite-coloured bishops, where White’s defence was complicated by the weakness of his h5-pawn and the presence of the opponent’s outside passed pawn on the a- file.

The h5-pawn will not run away, and first Black can activate his queen.’ (M.Gurevich) 469 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors 36 ±c3 Wd3 37 «fd4 To avoid the worst (37 Jtd4?! a5 or 37 JLb4?! ®d5) White exchanges queens, trans¬ posing into a bishop endgame a pawn down, since the h5-pawn is doomed. 37...®xd4 38 ±xd4 a5 39 c6? It would appear that Anand was already reconciled to defeat5 (Karpov). ‘A suicidal move, made instandyl! “The position was lost in any case,” said Anand at a press conference. Even if this is so (and to me, for example, it is not obvious), 39 c6? is the quickest way to lose.5 (M.Gurevich) Indeed, this move deserves a question mark, for the reason that it makes things easier for Black. It would appear that Vishy was right: this highly interesting ending with oppo¬ site-coloured bishops was already lost for White! We will consider two ways of defend¬ ing — with the pawn on f3 and with the pawn on f4: 1) 39 £3 JtxhS (39...£4!?) 40 c6 JUS 41 c7 ±d7 42 *£2 a4 43 ±c5 f4 (Ftacnik).

According to Karpov, the defensive line with 42 g3 a4 43 Jtb2 is more tenacious, but in my view this does not seriously complicate Black's task: 43...g5 44 4?f2 ^Pgb 45 4^3 Jtc8 46 Aa3 ±bl 47 Add <4>f7 48 3 <^e8 49 f4 4>d7 50 ±d6 i>cb 51 4>d4 gxf4 52 gxf4 h5 53 i>e3 4>d5 or 49 A,b4 *d7 50 ±d6 *c6 51 <4>d4 (if 51 f4, then 51...*d5 52 6cg5 hxg5 53 <£d3 i.a6+! 54 i>e3 <4>c4) 51...h5! 52 Ae7 (after 52 f4 gxf4 53 gxf4 h4 54 ^e3 ^dS the win is simple) 52...<i?xc7 53 Jtxg5 jtx£3 with two extra pawns and the imminent creation of a second passed pawn. 2) 39 f4 a4 40 ±b2 Jtxh5 41 c6 ±,e8 42 c7 Jtd7 43 <4)f2, and Black faces a difficult choice.

If 49...g4 he acquires the move 50 <4>h4 with a threat to the h6-pawn. And after 49...<^>f7, to take the king to the queenside, White captures the pawn (50 fxg5 hxg5 51 jtxg5), returns with his bishop (51...a3 52 Jtcl a2 53 jtb2), and then has time to exchange his weak g-pawn (53...sl?e7 54 <S?f4 <4)d7 55 g4 fxg4 56 <A)xg4 sbxcT) and re¬ turn with his king (57 ^f4 ‘Ahb 58 <4)e3 4^5 59 &d2). 49,..i.a6 50 <4>£3 gxf4 51 *xf4 52 g4 fxg4 53 <i)xg4 ^e7 is more cunning.

Nothing would have been changed by 39 lc3 a4 40 lb4 lxh5! 41 c6 le2! 42 c7 la6 (Karpov, Zaitsev). After f2-f3 or f2-f4 Black carries out one of the plans examined above. Thus it can be said with a large degree of cer¬ tainty that An and missed a draw earlier, al¬ though, if White had retained his c-pawn, the win for Black would have been more difficult Anand was hoping to ease his defence by re¬ taining an equal number of pawns on the kingside. 39...±xc6 40 f3 f4! Vishy underestimated this study-like possi¬ bility. cThe key move, which Karpov un¬ doubtedly foresaw in advance.’ (Zaitsev). Af¬ ter 40...Jte8 41 g4 the game would probably have ended in a draw. Now, however, Black picks up the h5-pawn and White, while deal¬ ing with the f4-pawn, is forced to allow the enemy passed pawn to reach a2. 41 ±b2 ±e8 42 Acl a4 43 Axf4 a3 44 Jle3 ±xh5 White’s downfall is caused by the weakness of his kingside pawns. If he places them on light squares, then the threat of their elimina¬ tion by the bishop means that the white king will be unable to head to the queenside, when the black king breaks through there. But plac¬ ing them on dark squares creates irreparable light-squared weaknesses, which the black king can exploit to set up a second passed pawn. 45 *f2 Or 45 g4 a2 46 ld4 1x8 47 f4 g6 (Black sets about creating a passed pawn) 48 *4*12 h5 49 <4g3 la4 50 <4>h4 4>h6 51 !c3 Idl 52 gxh5 gxh5 (Ftacnik) — now the white king will be tied to the h-pawn, while Black’s heads to the queenside. 45..

But 49 <4g2 g5 50 4f2 r4g6 51 *e3 h4 52 4f2 h3 is equally hopeless, while if 49 f4, then 49...4g6 50 <4e3 ‘i’S 51 lb2 <4>g4 52 <4*2 h4 53 gxh4 4xf4!

Incidentally, a couple of decades earlier Karpov had already won a similar ending with opposite-coloured bishops against Kurajica (Game No. 69). These two end¬ ings are an excellent illustration of how the 12th world champion succeeded with maxi¬ mum effect in exploiting imperceptible errors, committed by his opponents under the weight of mounting problems. cKarpov5s first win against Anand with Black!5 wrote grandmaster Mikhail Gurevich after the 4th game. "The loss has put Vishy in an extremely difficult match situation. As for the quality of his play in this game, it can be explained only by extreme tiredness. Human powers are not unlimited: behind him he al¬ ready had a month of continuous play...’ Nevertheless, Anand gained a draw in the 5th game without particular problems, and then he won the 6th, truly the £game of his life5: 3-3! ‘Of course, I did not expect that I would manage to win,5 he said immediately after the game, ‘and now I am very, very happy. I am so pleased that I have managed to level the scores, that for the moment I am not thinking about tomorrow’s tie-break. I will think about it later.5 A dramatic moment! Makarichev: ‘Vishy probably experienced a feeling of mental bankruptcy — the bankruptcy of a victor, when after very hard labours his joy mingles with numbness and apathy. But he still had to play the tie-break!5 Campomanes: ‘The same thing happened with Karpov as in 1987 in Seville: he again was unable to make a draw in the last, decisive game of the match. But in Seville there was no tie-break, but here there is one — and it is practically impossible to predict the winner.5 Karpov: ‘I was very upset: I lost a position in which there were no longer any dangers for Black. I didn’t calculate a variation. Well, and for a match that was going so well to come to such a state - that, of course, was a shock, and we hardly slept all night. Although we took a decision: no chess, no analysis of either the past, or the future — simply have a clear head. The only thing that helped was a cold shower before the game.5 The following day the fate of the match and of the FIDE crown was decided in a mini-match of two rapidplay games. It ap¬ peared that this was Anand’s forte, but at some point fatigue was bound finally to let him down. In the 1 st game with Black he ob¬ tained a completely winning position, and also a big advantage in time, but... he began to ‘drift5! Just before the end, the leader suddenly staggered and fell in the last few metres of the marathon. 39...£ixf3+? Black could have won by 39...a4! (Yusupov) 40 ±dl (40 £>g5 a3) 40...£kf3+ 41 ®xf3 ®xf3 42 HxB Se7 43 Jlxa4 (there is nothing else: 43 lc8+ Hxc8 44 ±xcS fia7) 43...flxc7 44 jtxb3 sfefB etc. 40 ®xf3 a4? (40...£M4! would still have re¬ tained a healthy extra pawn) 41 ®xf6 gxf6 42 ±67 £\d4? (42...fle7 with equality) 43 ±xe8 ^e2+ 44 4>g2 £\xc3 45 Jbcf7+ 4f8 46 ±xg6, and Black was unable to re¬ strain the onslaught of the white pawns (1-0). Karpov: ‘At the start of the 1 st game of the tie-break I felt'somehow sluggish, but then I livened up and my clarity and rapidity of thought returned... I think that Anand was 472 Anatoly the Twelfth simply not prepared for a fierce battle: he thought that he played better at rapidplay chess and that things were already setded. He gave every appearance of thinking that the champion's title was already his. But at the finish I composed myself better.’ However, judging by the 1st game, this was not the case: it was not Karpov who ‘composed himself and won, but Anand who switched off and lost. Zaitsev: ‘The break between the games — 15 minutes — was used by Karpov’s physical trainer Valery Krylov to massage his protege, whereas Elizbar Ubilava tried in vain to calm his down (“Vishy could no longer hear and see me: he wasn’t there...”). Alas, in the 2nd game Anand did not demonstrate the neces¬ sary strength of mind, lost control over him¬ self and the position, at a furious tempo gave up two pawns for no reason at all, and the first world championship match under the new system concluded.’ Thus Karpov retained his title of ‘king of FIDE’, provoking, however, a mixed reaction in the chess world. Dvoretsky ‘The odds were too colossal and undeserved! The extremely tired Anand had to fight against the fresh, well prepared Karpov. Even in these conditions he did not manage to win in “normal time”, and in the first rapidplay game he escaped defeat sim¬ ply by a miracle. Anand now, and this is not only my view, is much stronger than Karpov and would most probably have won if condi¬ tions had been equal (both players equally fresh or equally tired). Karpov has juridically become world champion, but in the eyes of nearly all chess players he is not so in effect.’ What can be done: after 1993 the question of who was the real champion — actual or ‘ju¬ ridical’, was one that everyone decided for himself, based on his likings... However, what for me is certain and is confirmed by the games given in this volume, is that Anatoly Karpov is one of the greatest epoch-creating players of the late 20th century, and his con¬ tribution to our knowledge of the subtleties of the ancient game is truly invaluable. It is appropriate to conclude this account of the 12th world champion’s career with the words of his long-standing trainer Igor Zait¬ sev: Tt is typical that with the black pieces Kar¬ pov has already been more attracted by those openings where the choice of variation re¬ mains with Black. For example, in the Caro- Kann — 4...£VT7 or 4.. JLf5, in the Ruy Lopez — the Smyslov, Breyer or Zaitsev Variations. The same can be said about the Queen’s In¬ dian Defence, and the Nimzo-Indian Defence. In my view, this is a non-deliberate manifesta¬ tion of the sensible efficiency, typical of this great player. ‘In drawing up various opening concep¬ tions, we, of course, mainly took into account the chess likings of Karpov himself. It has always seemed to me that, by beginning his direct preparations only at the very last mo¬ ment, he gives something of a handicap to all his match opponents and with the years this habit of his has only become more deep- rooted. Karpov has never been considered an openings expert, in view of the nature of his talent. In his best years he was a colossal prac¬ tical player with a staggering positional intui¬ tion, and he was always more inclined to trust his feeling, rather than long variations adjusted to fit a certain result. But at the same time his contribution to opening theory is sufficiently great and distinctive, like the contribution of the triumvirate of world champions — Capab- lanca, Smyslov and Petrosian, with a similar attitude and approach to opening problems.’ In conclusion — the traditional selection of opinions by world champions. Euwe: ‘By his style of play Karpov can be compared with the Cuban genius Capablanca, although there is also one important distinc¬ tion. When you play through Capablanca’s games, the thought involuntarily occurs to you: oh, it’s all so simple, even I could do that. By contrast, Karpov’s games initially startle 473 Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors you by their strategy, which seems illogical, but soon it becomes clear that in fact his play is extremely logical. like the Cuban, he is es¬ pecially tenacious in difficult positions. Capab- lanca and Karpov are similar in one other fea¬ ture — they lose extremely rarely... The Karpov phenomenon has no analogues; at any event, there have been so such champions before him. I have in mind not his youth and the speed with which he climbed to the chess summit, but his amazingly stable results and balanced play. Excellent play. In it there is so much adult grandmaster reckoning, so much sobriety and quiet confidence in himself, and in his powers!’ Botvinnik: ‘Many experts consider Karpov to be a rationalist, an uncommonly cold¬ blooded fighter, to whom emotions are com¬ pletely alien, and so on. Now the opposite can be affirmed: Karpov is emotional, like many people, but he masters and controls himself well, so that a false impression is created. He undoubtedly possesses a strong self- instruction program. He demonstrates an ex¬ cellent understanding of positional principles, and he has no equals in the art of harmoni¬ ously arranging his pieces. His pieces are usu¬ ally invulnerable, whereas the opponent’s pieces are subject to constant pressure. In this respect Karpov’s style is significantly better than that of Petrosian, who, after achieving an absolutely safe position for himself, would patiently wait for mistakes by the opponent. Karpov does not wait: he plays actively.’ Smyslov: ‘In Karpov’s play I have always been staggered by his amazing ability to so¬ berly and absolutely accurately evaluate the position on the board. To evaluate quickly, without spending much time on analysis. This comes from his fantastic chess intuition, from his innate talent. And after all, the correct evaluation of a position, the evaluation of your possibilities in it, is the basis of successful play. It is primarily this that distinguishes Karpov among the leading grandmasters in the world.’ Tal: ‘Karpov is fantastically purposeful. He is like a tank, which cannot be diverted from its goal. His iron persistence is torture for the faint hearted. Not without reason have some of my colleagues lamented after losing to Kar¬ pov: it’s impossible to play — he puts pressure on your mind. Karpov’s character is the same as his play. Both in life, and at the chessboard, he is extremely purposeful. This is the main thing about him. It can be said that his strong aspects are precisely what I am lacking. Kar¬ pov has a simply classic way of converting an advantage — I have never learned to do this. At critical moments he is able to control his impulses — I cannot restrain my emotions... Anatoly has always staggered me by his ability to defend, as they say, to the last, where many others would already have lost heart.’ Petrosian: ‘Karpov demonstrates with his performances that he has a very purposeful nature. His chess outlook is clearly outlined. This is very important. Every improving tal¬ ented player should have his outlook, his tastes, his likings, his point of view on certain chess problems — theoretical, practical and philosophical. Fischer has his firm states, and he is amazingly constant in his sympathies. We observe roughly the same with Karpov. True, Karpov’s style is still evolving. I think that he will be a universal and versatile player.’ Spassky: ‘Karpov is a chess genius, but in the ideological sense he is similar to Botvinnik. Karpov used the support of the Party to achieve his personal aims. And later he began to justify these as being the aims of the state... But one has to give him his due: as a chess player he is indeed great.’ 474 BIBLIOGRAPHY Russian Titles Averbakh Yu.L. and Turov B.I. Shakhmatnye olimpiady. Moscow, 1974. Averbakh Yu.L.
